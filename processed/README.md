# ðŸ”— CONNECT MODE - Making Connections

**Purpose:** Where dots connect and patterns emerge.

## Subfolders

### `/synthesis/` - Cross-Pollination
When you connect multiple sources into new insights
- References multiple `/raw/` files
- Your NEW thinking emerges here
- Pattern recognition lives here

### `/refined/` - Polished Thinking
Taking rough ideas and structuring them
- Still your voice but organized
- Ready for shipping but not shipped yet
