# Voice Memos - AI-Native Knowledge System

**Last Updated:** October 2025  
**Philosophy:** Capture Everything → Connect Dots → Ship Value → Run Systems

---

## The Four Modes

Ask yourself: "What mode am I in?"

### 🎤 CAPTURE MODE → `/raw/`
*New information coming in*
- Brain dump? → `/raw/me/`
- YouTube/Book/Course? → `/raw/external/`
- Team meeting? → `/raw/team/`

### 🔗 CONNECT MODE → `/processed/`
*Making sense of what I've captured*
- Connecting dots across sources? → `/processed/synthesis/`
- Cleaning up rough ideas? → `/processed/refined/`

### 🚀 SHIP MODE → `/shipped/`
*Putting my name on it*
- LinkedIn/Blog post? → `/shipped/articles/`
- My methodology/framework? → `/shipped/frameworks/`
- Sending to client? → `/shipped/client-assets/`

### ⚙️ RUN MODE → `/operations/`
*Making the machine work*
- Setting up AI agents? → `/operations/agents/`
- Creating prompts? → `/operations/prompts/`
- Onboarding someone/something? → `/operations/onboarding/`

## Quick Start

1. **Recording a voice memo?**
```
   raw/me/YYYYMMDD_Category_Topic.md
```

2. **Watched great YouTube video?**
```
   raw/external/YYYYMMDD_Creator_Topic.md
```

3. **Connecting ideas?**
```
   processed/synthesis/YYYYMMDD_Connection_Topic.md
```

4. **Ready to publish?**
```
   shipped/articles/YYYYMMDD_Title.md
```

## The System is Agile

- **No rigid rules** - If unsure, dump it in `_quick/` and sort later
- **Evolution expected** - This will change as needs change
- **AI-first** - Everything structured for machines AND humans
- **Speed matters** - Capture now, organize later

---

## For Machines

Every file should have:
```yaml
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
mode: [capture|connect|ship|run]
type: [voice-memo|external|synthesis|article|framework|prompt]
sources: [list of connected files]
tags: [searchable, keywords]
status: [raw|processing|complete]
---
```

## Remember

"I don't know how this is gonna evolve. And I don't know how I'm gonna plan to use this down the line. But I want it to be ready for whatever the fuck I throw at it."

This system is built for that.
