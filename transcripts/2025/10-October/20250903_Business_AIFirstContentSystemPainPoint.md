# From Brain Dump to Bank Account - Building AI-First Systems That Solve Your Own Pain Points

## Transcript

First of all, I am AJ and this is the project that I'm working on right now. I am a junior consultant at Analytics AIML and I also work at Mattress Firm as a sleep expert. I'd like to build different types of AI tools and projects and apps, and I just play around with AI tools all day.

I've built a couple different tools, one of them being Me Too B, which is basically a tap to capture system where you brain dump everything and then capture interactions that happen with customers in store in order to ensure you don't lose important information about the process that you've taken a customer through. And then I have that transcribed as text, that text gets analyzed and populates itself into a really intuitive customer profile and it saves all the context and the video and then it has AI empowered tools to extract detailed information that it may have missed the first time. You can plug things into your calendar. It's pretty intricate. It's a lot to it. But that's not a major embarkment that I'm working on. It's just an app I built while I was, you know, just building the app because I had a pain point at work, right? And that's usually what I do. And that's where I'm at now.

Right now, I am in the process of understanding—I do a lot of deep research on projects and a lot of the time things get messy, muddied, and it's frustrating. And trying to bounce between different LLMs or large AI agents or just different AI tools, I'm forced to try to provide all the context I started with in the first chat to the next and the next and the next, and then I'm losing valuable pieces of context in between these processes, right?

So this is why I'm developing this tool specifically for people like me who struggle with this type of problem, who use AI tools on a regular basis and starting to realize how much content and data can be produced, but want to be able to have a systemized way of sorting, organizing and leveraging this data as an asset.

And what I found is that a lot of this starts with something like what I'm doing right now, for me, at least. It's a brain dump. I just kind of spit it all out, speak to it, and allow my thoughts to flow naturally and then have AI assist me with some of the heavy lifting and the mental—it just requires a lot of mental strain to organize all of this, and AI can do that heavy lifting very quickly. So I like to leverage tools that increase productivity. So that's what I'm doing here. And this is a perfect example.

Now, I also like to express the point that in this world we live in, everything is content, right? Or content worthy, usually if it can add value for somebody else. This whole process that I'm going through takes time. I'm taking a lot of time out of my day just to work through solving this problem. If it's taking me time to work through solving this problem and other people have a similar problem, but they don't want to invest this type of time into it because usually they may be working on something else that's eating up their time, then I have an asset that I can add to the marketplace that helps people reduce friction and eliminate time restraints and speed up productivity.

And as long as I can capture the entire process and speak to it and create different types of training and content and pieces that can help people go from not fully understanding to fully understanding and then embracing and leveraging it and utilizing it, I have a tool worth sharing, and also worth selling, because it took time. That was the input, right? That was the input. I invested time. And then the output is the solution that I've created. And so if you're able to package that kind of—package that up and systemize it and turn it into a product that can be delivered, you have something that can make you some money, right? And that's business.

So, right now, I've been working through my process for solving this explicit pain point for myself. I find myself trying to copy threads and chat contexts and windows and things like that, and screenshots and all this stuff. And I'm trying to save it in Google Docs and put all this stuff here and there and it just gets messy and then who has time to think, okay, how do I, like, what do I save this file name as? Just simple little things like that, right?

So what I'm trying to do is basically train each of these agents, these micro agents, in a part of the task to where they execute it at a high level, just like I would if I was to spend a lot of time and effort diving into each one of these tasks, and then get them up to speed to the point where they quickly hand off and execute each one of these steps in automation, right? And then I have a deliverable at the end. And then I have different areas or different time points where I can insert myself as the human in the loop to provide context.

I definitely like to start with human context and subject matter expertise to frame and provide the nuance and the important details that AI will miss because it's a large language model, but we are subject matter experts and we understand the human aspects and we have the stories that can really relate to people.

So, I found that the more longwinded I can be with AI to provide it all the context it needs, all the understanding that it needs to fully articulate back to me what I'm trying to say, I can get it to the point where I'm like, oh, okay, you got that. Okay, we have this big structure or this big piece of, I don't know, stone, right? And then we chisel away at it until it becomes a masterpiece. And once that masterpiece starts to show itself and emerges, we just keep ticking away at it until it's like, that's it. That's exactly what I was trying to say. That's what I want right here. Okay, cool. We can move forward with this.

But in this messy stage, the most important part of what I want the LLM to do or the agent in this phase, what I want it to do is articulate back to me what I'm trying to say and organize my thoughts in a way where I'm like, yes, perfect. Okay, that's easy, that's an easy way for another human being to quickly follow and sequence what's going on and understand at a high level, all of this context without having to start over from the beginning.

And then I also understand that I'm going to need to train agents, AI agents, and other large language models. I'm gonna need to also have this in a machine format where it can quickly be ingested and brought up to speed on the project at hand. So I need it to be in machine language as well, as human facing, right?

And then from there, I can take those rich bodies of context and produce content with them, or, in this case, like, say, I want to do some deep research. I can take that and say, hey, look, this is what I'm on right now. I want to create a master prompt that will give me a master deep research prompt based on everything that we have here. And then I want to go and feed it to four large language models, trigger on the deep research button and let them go to work, right? And then I just extract all that data as soon as it's all outputted. And then now I have some basis and some facts behind everything to back everything up, right?

So these are all new pieces of content and data that can be plugged in and all of this becomes a big tangled mess if it's not structured properly and organized, and automated in a way where things start getting processed and plugged in and saved properly. And then also thinking like, this has to work AI first and then I can always generate a piece of the content with this, but I can train agents and I can train humans and all of that, right? So I need to think through all of this right now.

So that's big picture. That's where I'm at right now with this project. So what I don't want is for you to get muddied with Me Too B or Analytics AIML, or AJ. What I want you to think about is the process in solving for the problems, the pain points that I've outlined here, understanding the rich body of content that I have as far as why I'm doing this and how this can help and basically how it can be monetized down the line.

If it's packaged properly, because the better that you learn how to package these things and automate these processes, the quicker you can go from conception to product to stacking your bank account.

## Key Points

- AJ: junior consultant at Analytics AIML, sleep expert at Mattress Firm, builds AI tools all day to solve personal pain points
- Me Too B app: tap-to-capture brain dump system for customer interactions—transcribes, analyzes, populates intuitive customer profiles, saves context + video, has AI tools to extract missed details, calendar integration—"just an app I built because I had a pain point at work"
- Core pain point being solved: bouncing between different LLMs/agents, forced to re-provide context in each new chat, losing valuable pieces of context between processes—"things get messy, muddied, and it's frustrating"
- Target user: people who use AI tools regularly, realize how much content/data can be produced, want systemized way of sorting, organizing, leveraging this data as an asset
- Brain dump as starting point: "I just kind of spit it all out, speak to it, and allow my thoughts to flow naturally and then have AI assist me with some of the heavy lifting"—AI handles mental strain of organization
- Monetization logic: "If it's taking me time to work through solving this problem and other people have a similar problem, but they don't want to invest this type of time into it... then I have an asset that I can add to the marketplace"
- Time as input, solution as output: "I invested time. And then the output is the solution that I've created. And so if you're able to package that up and systemize it and turn it into a product that can be delivered, you have something that can make you some money"
- Current messy process: copying threads, chat contexts, screenshots, saving in Google Docs everywhere—"who has time to think, okay, what do I save this file name as?"
- Micro-agent strategy: train each agent in part of the task to execute at high level, then hand off and execute steps in automation—deliverable at end with time points for human-in-the-loop context insertion
- Human context critical: "We are subject matter experts and we understand the human aspects and we have the stories that can really relate to people"—AI misses nuance without human framing
- Chisel metaphor: "We have this big piece of stone, right? And then we chisel away at it until it becomes a masterpiece... we just keep ticking away at it until it's like, that's it. That's exactly what I was trying to say"
- Dual output requirement: needs to be in machine language (for training agents/LLMs) AND human facing (for quick understanding without starting over)
- Deep research workflow example: create master deep research prompt from context, feed to four LLMs, trigger button, extract all data—now have basis and facts to back everything up
- AI-first design principle: "This has to work AI first and then I can always generate a piece of content with this, but I can train agents and I can train humans"
- Meta-instruction to AI: "What I don't want is for you to get muddied with Me Too B or Analytics AIML, or AJ. What I want you to think about is the process in solving for the problems"—focus on transferable process, not specifics
- Ultimate formula: "The better that you learn how to package these things and automate these processes, the quicker you can go from conception to product to stacking your bank account"
