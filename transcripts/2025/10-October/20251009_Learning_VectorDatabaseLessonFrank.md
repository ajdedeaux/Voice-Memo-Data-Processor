# Why Was the Vector Database Created? - Frank's Masterclass in Asking Deeper Questions

## Transcript

Okay. So I don't think—I don't like the way this is all structured out. I don't like it at all. So let me kind of explain my thought process and how I understood this to unfold and why I think the lesson, the deep lesson behind it all is extremely powerful.

In the morning meeting, we started as always 5AM, Zoom, meeting as a team and exploring the latest in AI tech. This morning was no different, but today, we decided to break out into two groups, two breakout groups. One was design, one was gonna work on really mastering—getting or not mastering, but understanding how to use AgentKit, the new OpenAI agent platform. So we've all been struggling to get access to it and actually be able to play around in it, but a couple guys already have that access. So that team kinda broke out, and a few other people decided to go in at the same time and learn and build an agent and play around. So the goal was to build an agent that could build out content, a piece of content for an article for one of our clients, which is something that they do on a regular basis.

So they did that. And once we all finished up with the breakout rooms, they come back in, and they're ready to present what they built. They ended up building something out. Cool. Great.

So they're explaining, and one of our teammates in particular is going through explaining it, showing how he plugged this up and attached this node here, added this there, etcetera, etcetera. When he got to the vector database, something about what he said caught my—our mentor, Frank. He caught his eye or his—he perked up to it. Maybe it was the way he sounded when he was explaining it. Maybe he missed something, but our mentor and founder, he is a subject matter expert. He's been doing this for a long time. And so he knows when somebody knows what they're talking about, and then he knows when to push back.

So when he got to the vector database, he decided this is where he pushed back. And he said, hey. So why did you use this here? And the explanation he got wasn't as clear and concise as what he wanted to get. So he pushed back even further. He said, what is a vector database? And the answer, it was kind of a roundabout type of answer. And so he stops him, which he always does. I'm gonna stop you right there because you're kinda going around, but you still haven't answered my question. And I don't think you fully understand.

And so then he paused, and he said and addressed the rest of the group. Okay. And this is within our Zoom call, our recorded Zoom call. He's like, okay. Who, alright. Who else can explain this? We've used vector databases. We know we've talked about them, but who can explain what a vector database is?

And one by one, we all kind of piggybacked off the last person and tried our best to explain it. None of us fully grasped it. And as soon as he understood that, he stopped the entire thing. Alright. Everybody go figure out what a vector database is and come back and be able to explain it.

So that's when I jumped into this chat thread and this is me trying to figure out very quickly before I'm called on what a vector database is and absorb this information quickly and conceptually so I can understand how to explain it back in a way that makes sense. So I always use—I use these prompts all the time. Like, teach, help me understand this like I am a child, like I'm a fifth grader. Break it down. Tell me a story. That's how I like to learn. So I break it down. I don't have any shame in my game. This is how I learn. It's how I absorb information quickly. It's how I conceptualize things. It's how I move faster and ask better questions as soon as I get the big picture.

And as I ask these questions, which I'd like for you to kinda explain and share and show or I can attach, I started to really understand what a vector database was and why it was important. I'm like, oh, okay. It's starting to all kinda click. So I explain it when he calls on me, and I think as a whole, our answers were much better. Better developed. We're kinda learning from each other and like, oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. Okay. Yeah. And so we're learning, passing this around.

And he stopped, and he's like, well, that's all good, but what you need to be asking is why was the vector database created in the first place? What does it solve? What solution does this vector database solve? Why was it created? When was it created, and why was it so important that it was adopted so widely?

So this is where we're like, oh, wow. That is a complete different way to look at a problem, right, or a tool. Like, a tool is—this is a solution to a problem. So it's not the shovel somebody wants. It's the hole in the ground. Right? So what hole in the ground or what is the equivalent of the hole in the ground for this? Why was everybody so happy when this came along?

And then once I asked that question, I really started to understand. Oh, wow. Okay. I know what that feels like to go through my search in Google and try to find this one email so I can cancel a subscription. And I'm typing this in, but I'm like, oh, it kinda sounds like this. It kinda sounds like that. But, man, it's this one—like, you're just—we're speaking in circles. And it's like try—like, a vector database is able to take all of that and then help me find what I'm looking for instead of me trying to remember the exact keyword or name of the document as I typed it or as close as I can. That wastes so much time. There's so much waste that goes into looking and looking for documents, and that's why it was created. It helps us as humans find things faster and helps machines understand context in a way that allows it to surface the information that we need right away.

And then this is where I really start to understand. Like, okay. If it is a vector database, this is why a vector database would be used in this specific type of situation. This is the specific hole this tool digs. Right? Perfect.

And then he went on to explain that a vector database or a large language model reads these type of—or then he also said, like, when you plug in—we were plugging—the problem was we were plugging in a PDF to have it read through a chart or something. Something wrong. Right? And he's like, a large language model speaks language. It understands language. You don't want the large language model to try to be a mathematician. If you want it to understand math, you need to feed it in the right language. So Python is the language it understands. And when you connect that to a vector database and it's structured properly, that's where you get major improvements, and you get really concise information fast.

So this is where everything started to come together and we started to understand. But by asking deeper questions, understanding how to learn better and ask better questions, it helps us upskill ourselves and takes us from someone that's just connecting wires to someone that's really orchestrating the show. And that's why it's so important to have somebody that's much smarter than you that understands the big picture and all the little nuances pressing down on you to help you learn fast. And as a group, I feel like this is one of the superpowers that we have, and I hope this type of content helps somebody else think, open their mind and think about something a different way.

## Key Points

- 5AM Zoom meeting with Analytics AIML team, broke into two groups—one working on AgentKit (new OpenAI agent platform) to build content-generation agent for client
- Teammate presented agent build, got to vector database explanation—Frank (mentor/founder/subject matter expert) immediately detected shallow understanding and pushed back
- Frank's first push: "Why did you use this here?" Answer wasn't clear. Second push: "What is a vector database?" Answer was roundabout—"I'm gonna stop you right there. I don't think you fully understand"
- Frank addressed entire team on recorded Zoom: "Who can explain what a vector database is?" One by one everyone tried, none fully grasped it—Frank stopped everything: "Everybody go figure out what a vector database is"
- Speaker's learning method: "Help me understand this like I am a child, like I'm a fifth grader. Break it down. Tell me a story"—no shame, this is how to absorb quickly and ask better questions
- After quick research and re-explanation, Frank reframed entirely: "What you need to be asking is why was the vector database created in the first place? What does it solve? Why was it adopted so widely?"
- The shift: "It's not the shovel somebody wants. It's the hole in the ground"—tools are solutions to problems, understand the problem first
- Vector database pain point realization: searching for "that one email to cancel a subscription" but typing vague keywords in circles—massive time waste trying to remember exact document names
- Vector databases solve: help humans find things faster, help machines understand context to surface needed information immediately without exact keyword matching
- LLM insight from Frank: "A large language model speaks language. You don't want the large language model to try to be a mathematician. If you want it to understand math, you need to feed it in the right language"—Python is the language it understands
- "By asking deeper questions, understanding how to learn better and ask better questions, it helps us upskill ourselves and takes us from someone that's just connecting wires to someone that's really orchestrating the show"
- The superpower: having someone much smarter who understands the big picture and all the nuances pressing down on you to help you learn fast
