# "You Mean You Have to Use Your Hands?" - The Back to the Future Moment We're Living Right Now

## Transcript

Here are a few stories that I'd like to maybe weave into all of this. Let's see. I remember the modem having to fire up as a kid and how it plugged up the phone line—if you're on the Internet, it's gonna be busy. That old school dial-up connection with the AOL man running and that moving into just Google search and Yahoo and email addresses and being able to reach out to my uncle from across, from California and him being in Florida.

I don't even know if that's content creation, but the—here's a story that I always think about, right? Especially this day and age. One story that I always think about goes back to this movie that I always loved as a kid because I've always loved the sci-fi stuff, anything that gets my imagination going, right? So the movie Back to the Future, the very first one, right? Where Marty McFly is in, he just comes to the future. He's in the future and he's going into this sports bar and he orders a Coke, right? And while he's ordering the Coke, he looks over and he sees this old school video game and it has the guns and you're shooting and stuff like that, right?

So some kids, he notices it, but he's kind of doing his own thing. He's getting his Coke. And then he hears the kids like, man, how do you—slapping the game, talking about, man, how do you use this thing? And he's like, hey, watch out, kids. Let me show you guys. I'm a pro, you know? And he steps in and he picks up the two guns and he's really, like, he knows this stuff, right? And the game starts, and he starts shooting, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing, knocking everybody down. And then he spins the guns and puts them back, right? And he just thought he was the shit.

And the kids looked at him crazy and were like, you mean you have to use your hands? And then they left, right? And that always reminds me of where we're at with this technology. It's like to create something, all we have to do is type, text, drop an image, is almost to the point where we don't even have to use our hands. Like, we can just type. Like, that's one of the things that I love most about some of these chat interfaces is I could just talk to it. I just talk to it. And it gets it.

I'm sitting here talking right now, explaining this story from back in the day when I was a kid and tying it back into current day into an article, a piece of content that I'm trying to create right now real time and trying to figure out like, OK, these are all these thoughts and these concepts I have. How do I weave them into a story or into this storyline to help people understand what's possible right now?

Because I think the only limitation right now is your ability to perceive what's possible. And unless you're actually playing with these tools and really immersing yourself in what's possible, you just don't know what you don't know.

And now being at the point that I'm at, I've been playing with these tools since ChatGPT launched. I moved out here to Florida from prison. I just did 10 years, almost 10 years, almost nine years in federal prison. And the entire time I was in prison, I was reading. I was in the Stone Ages. I had to read everything by hand. I didn't have any access to the Internet to do quick searches so I'm doing everything manually by hand, writing things out. I have boxes and boxes of books and notes and everything all open over the years. And books underlined and scribbled and all kinds of stuff, right?

And the whole time I was in there, I was like, man, if I could just research this one thing, if I could just get the information, if I could just access this information, I could move so much faster. And like, I just, there was—I didn't—I'm behind a wall with no access to the real world. I don't know how fast everything is moving, not for real, because I'm not in it.

And I'm reading books and Homo Deus while Yuval Harari. His book really kind of opened my mind to what was really going on out in the world while I was locked up. And it made me remember what my uncle had been telling me this whole time. He's been talking about AI for years. Back in '08 when I first was like 18—or 17, whatever, in '08, I was out here and he was trying to get me up to speed. He was always talking about AI. He's been talking about this for a long time. So he was sending me books while I was locked up.

And as soon as I was about to get released, I got denied going back home, and it's the biggest blessing of all time because I reached out to my uncle and once again, he acted like an uncle, a mentor, and even though I had messed up, he said, hey, you know, you can come on out here, you got to get out here, man. You got to get out here. Everything is changing. You got to get out here.

And so I came to Florida fresh out of prison, 10 years behind the scenes, and was introduced to ChatGPT for the first time. Right when it launched. This is 2023, and I've been playing with these tools ever since. And sometimes I don't realize how much I've learned or how adept I am at using these tools and what's possible.

Because that's what we do every single day at Analytics AIML, just play with these large language models, these chat interfaces, these AI tools, and stay up to speed on it, and we press each other, and we press, and we press, and we explore, and we try, and we learn new things, and we share what we learn.

And that's what it's all about right now. We're at the space where there's a slight gap, a little opening. And if you can be one of the early adopters, the first movers, you're going to know so much more because some people are just trying to figure out how to put together a prompt.

I see people on social media creating images where they're putting an image of themselves with the Scream person in the background, right? And they're generating an image. And then I see people in the chat like, what's the prompt? What's the prompt? And I'm like, you could just ask, you know, it'll just tell you, and you can—it's like, you don't need the prompt, you just need to know. You just need to know that you can ask it and it'll tell you, and it'll develop it. Or that you can copy, screenshot the picture that you're trying to get and then drop it in ChatGPT and say, hey, look, there's this viral trend going on. And I want to know how to do this, teach me how to do this. Or like, what's the prompt for this?

Like, you don't have to—you can just ask ChatGPT and it'll be patient with you, more patient. You can just ask and ask and ask until you figure it out. And that's the first thing you should do. Always just go. You have everything that you need to figure it out yourself. And if you run into blocks, then there's communities and there's people that will help you get further.

And that's what I'm lucky to have at Analytics AIML. If I run into an issue where I run into something I don't know the answer to, I just share with the team. And then we break it apart and figure it out. So these are some of the things that I'm learning.

And having come from doing years in federal prison to getting out and 10Xing my productivity and being the top 1% within my district as a sales rep from the first day on the sales floor. It's not because I'm smarter. It's just I know what's out there. I know what's possible, and I'm pushing fast. I move faster. I think through things more strategically because I'm augmented with AI tools. These are second nature to me.

So I think when people are like, oh, AI is gonna make people dumb or I don't know. Maybe if, but I feel like it speeds up my creativity, my ability to answer questions. And it goes back to Henry Ford in that book, as recounted by Napoleon Hill in Think and Grow Rich. I have a button at my fingertip to answer any question that I need and now to generate any type of piece of content that I need or at least give me partially there or on the way further than I could have got by myself with no experience. Like, this is where we're at.

And I read that book in prison within this ten year, probably early on in my bid. But that's a story that I learned and read in prison. And I'm using it now in content to help explain a concept that I find very interesting. And these are just some of the stories that I'm starting to realize and I want to share. So take it for what it's worth.
