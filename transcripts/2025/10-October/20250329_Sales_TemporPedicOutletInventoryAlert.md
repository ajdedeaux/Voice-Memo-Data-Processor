# FB Marketplace Tempur-Pedic Outlet Alert - "Don't Call Me If You're Not Ready to Go"

## Transcript

Inventory, inventory alert, alert, alert, alert. Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze firm. I got two—excuse me, I got one. Cal King, it's the only one I got in outlet. All right? Love Tempur-Pedic, hate the price. Cal King, Luxe Breeze, firm. That means it's gonna cool you down, it's gonna keep you supported, and it's gonna come back time and time and time again. It has a ten year warranty and maintains the warranty, even in outlet, even when I get you a good deal.

Next, Luxe Breeze, soft, the soft one. You gotta like a soft mattress, you gonna sink down in this. This is what I sleep in. Side sleepers, you like this.

Here's the last one. ProBreeze, Hybrid. Hybrid means it coils on the bottom. So it's gonna sink, conform to your body and get to know you, and then underneath it is gonna have coils to support you.

Don't call me, don't hit me if you're not ready to go. These things don't last. Love a mattress, hate the price. I'm your guy. Inventory, inventory, inventory alert.
