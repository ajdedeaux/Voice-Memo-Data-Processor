# AI as the Button Under Henry Ford's Desk - The Sensory Evolution From Reading to Reasoning

## Transcript

Just found something, like, pretty insightful to me, all right? So what makes AI so powerful if we look back through just the lens of content creation, right? Let's go back to Gutenberg, we'll trace back from the 600 years of content creation and let's look at it.

So Gutenberg was able to mass produce text where Luther was or whatever and the printing press was something that was leveraged, that tool, that technology was leveraged to spread ideas in written format to the masses and it disrupted the hierarchy of control and the gatekeepers, right? But why? Because people began to read, to understand, to learn, to question things and make up their own decisions. They began to get more intelligent by instead of just listening to what other people were telling them, they were able to reason and think for themselves and learn. And they developed a skill. It was reading and comprehension, right? That technology soon became, you know, the next thing that the gatekeepers flooded around and a new gatekeeper emerged, right?

Then a new technology was born—the airwaves, the radio, and now we see another disruptor. We see someone come in and leverage this tool in a way that hadn't been done before so much, right? So one example is Franklin D. Roosevelt, FDR, and his fireside chats, right? Now, he was able to come into the home and into the ears of the people and talk to them, right? They were able to hear them. First they were able to read, reason, understand. Now they're able to hear you, listen and get more context and more understanding because this is how we learn, right? We can hear now. We can hear this person. We can build more trust.

So as that evolved, same patterns emerge, right? But the next technology that emerged was the TV and now the TV adds another medium and another glimpse of the entire picture and that picture is the visual aspects. So now not only can people read, comprehend, understand, they can hear things and be swayed like that. But now they have the big picture and they can actually see it. They can actually make judgments based on what they're seeing. When you see something, they say, seeing is believing, right? So now we have the whole picture of the person or of the argument. We get to use all our sensory, like more of the sensory pieces to help us make a decision.

Now TV exploded. One of the people that really made an impact with this as an example is the Nixon and Kennedy election. And Nixon was looking crazy on TV while Kennedy was looking like the showman, right? And people trusted him. They saw that and it swayed the vote. Then a bunch of things start to happen. You got TV stars and other people who know how to leverage this new medium and create these new content and then the fucking gatekeepers come and you have these big media companies that pretty much run everything and they feed us what they want us to see and hear and believe. And that runs rampant for a long freaking time.

And then you have something new comes around—the Internet, right? The Internet comes around and shakes shit up and there's a new skill must get developed. The skill is now coding. This decentralized the printing and the—you'd have to have a printer or a newspaper article. You have to—I remember how much you have to pay to get a commercial or get an ad or anything, right? And then you have the internet. And if you knew how to code, then you pretty much—it was free almost, right? You could just go in there and if you learn how to code. So people learned how to code. And the people that learned how to code did very well, are probably still doing very well that learned how to code from that period, right?

And then internet shifted everything. And as we see, you had Google emerge. And now not only is it enough to—the information is out there. Now it's like, how do I get to it quickly, right? How do I get to this information quickly? And Google helped do that and Google has freaking dominated.

And then YouTube comes. And now the whole—there used to be TV. People used to watch TV. People now watch YouTube and they watch content creators. And now these content creators are the ones that can take all these different mediums and they can create their own broadcast channel and broadcast themselves on YouTube for nothing as long as they produce good content and they feed the algorithm, which Mr. Beast has mastered. This is what's going on.

And now we've moved into an AI, the AI revolution, and it is combining everything. Let me explain. AI can read, it can reason, it can hear, it can see, it can code in any language. It understands the algorithm, but what it doesn't have is the direction, the system. It doesn't have the human in the loop. It doesn't have the person guiding it. It needs to be guided through prompts, through systematic engineering. There's more to it and the people who understand how to leverage this tool are going to be the Henry Ford of this new wave.

And people laughed at Henry Ford when he got, you know, they said he was stupid and he didn't know this and didn't know that, and they tried to sue him and they gave him six cents for all of that stuff. But Henry Ford knew something that other people didn't realize. It wasn't about being the person that knew everything. It's the person that knows how to press the right button to get anything done. And Henry Ford articulated that or maybe Napoleon Hill in his book Think and Grow Rich embodied that or brought that to life through his story. Like, why do I need to do that? Why do I need to know everything when I have this button under my desk where I can summon anybody to answer any question that I need at any time?

So what are you doing with AI? Are you building that button? Are you leveraging that button? Are you a business owner who is empowering their employees to leverage and push these buttons? Are you building your button? Because if you're not, you're in trouble. And you can't replace the person with the button. You have to give your people the button. That is what takes people from regular to super supercharged.

And then they have subject matter expertise, supercharged with the ability to press buttons, get information and answers and develop content and build content at the spur of a moment that also have human touch to it and that human essence. Listen, that's how you transform your business from the inside. Supercharge your employees, give them the buttons that they can push to serve your customers at 250X speed. That's value. That is value creation and that's how you blow up a business and that's how you leverage AI in this new space.

## Key Points

- Gutenberg's printing press enabled reading and comprehension—people developed ability to "reason and think for themselves and learn" instead of just listening to what they were told
- FDR's fireside chats added hearing layer: "They were able to read, reason, understand. Now they're able to hear you, listen and get more context"—building trust through voice
- TV added visual layer (seeing is believing): Nixon vs. Kennedy election—"Nixon was looking crazy on TV while Kennedy was looking like the showman"—visuals swayed the vote
- Internet required new skill (coding): "If you knew how to code, then it was free almost"—decentralized broadcast, eliminated need for expensive ads/commercials
- Google solved information access speed problem: "How do I get to this information quickly?"—dominated through algorithmic organization
- YouTube disrupted TV: content creators can "create their own broadcast channel and broadcast themselves on YouTube for nothing"—Mr. Beast mastered feeding the algorithm
- AI combines everything: "AI can read, it can reason, it can hear, it can see, it can code in any language. It understands the algorithm"—accumulation of all prior sensory/skill layers
- Critical limitation: "What it doesn't have is the direction, the system. It doesn't have the human in the loop"—needs guidance through prompts and systematic engineering
- Henry Ford insight from Think and Grow Rich: "It wasn't about being the person that knew everything. It's the person that knows how to press the right button to get anything done"
- The button under Ford's desk: "Why do I need to know everything when I have this button where I can summon anybody to answer any question that I need at any time?"
- "You can't replace the person with the button. You have to give your people the button"—augmentation not replacement
- Transformation formula: subject matter expertise + button-pressing ability = "supercharged with the ability to press buttons, get information and answers and develop content at the spur of a moment that also have human touch"
- Business directive: "Supercharge your employees, give them the buttons that they can push to serve your customers at 250X speed. That's value creation"
