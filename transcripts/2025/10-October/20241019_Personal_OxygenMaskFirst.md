# Put Your Mask On - The Plane's Going Down

## Transcript

Welp... it's been a long night fighting with my girl so I went outside and did this:

Put your mask on, the plane's going down. Put your mask on. No. Don't try to help the person next to you. Put your mask on. That's what they tell us in a plane. Put your mask on first before you help somebody else.

In this relationship, I feel like I put my mask on. I got my mask on, but... My girl, she doesn't have her mask on. And I'm trying to tell her, "Hey, put your mask on." And she's like, "No, no. You're not listening to me. You're not listening to my feelings." 

Like, "Okay, but first, put your mask on."

"No, you need to listen to my feelings. You need to listen to my feelings. You need to understand me."

And I'm like, "Okay, hold up. First, let me, I'm gonna try to put your mask on."

Swats my hands away. "No, fuck that fucking mask. Listen to my feelings. Listen to my feelings. You're not listening to my feelings. I'm scared."

And I'm like, "Bitch, you finna pass out. We need to put your fucking mask on."

But nope. She just wants to talk about how scared and afraid she is about the plane going down without first putting her mask on. The first thing we need to do is put your mask on. If you don't have the first thing taken care of, it's over. This is the fundamental. You gotta put your mask on, or you finna pass out and the plane's going down. 

It's just put your mask on. Let me talk about everything else afterward.
