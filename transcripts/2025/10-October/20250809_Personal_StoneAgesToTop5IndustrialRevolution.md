# From Stone Ages to 100K in Two Years - Why You Can't Afford to Wait on AI

## Transcript

All right. I'm at work, but I got some free time so I wanna talk to you. Two years ago, I was living in the Stone Ages. I was just released from federal prison. I had done, I don't know, almost 10 years. Today I'm earning over 100K. I'm the top sales rep in my district. I've been out two years now, and my uncle brought me in, he's a high level business consultant. I've been playing around with AI tools since the day I got released.

If I can master these tools and leverage them and put myself in position where I'm earning over 100K a year, you can do this too. There's no fucking excuses.

Here's the reality check. We are in an industrial revolution right now. AI isn't coming. It's already here and companies are leveraging these AI tools to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Now that means you or you can get left behind.

I was reading books I was locked down, all right? My uncle sent me a book called Homo Deus. It's by Yuval Harari and in the book he mentions something called the useless class. It's basically saying that there's going to be a new class of people who get displaced by technology and they no longer can add value to the economy. I read this while I was in prison. The only had was email. Everything else was getting sent in by the mail. I'm reading books. I got my pen, paper, highlighter, I'm highlighting stuff, but I was scared to death. That scared me. I was in prison reading, and it scared me.

I'm sure that you've seen everything that's going on. And if you're not a little on edge about this, then I don't know what to tell you because I'm still on edge about it. So there's nothing you can do about it. Businesses are in business to generate revenue and add value. AI helps decrease costs, increase productivity and efficiency, and everybody's using it. If a business doesn't use it, then they get left behind. That's not good business.

So you have two options. You can just run around scared or act like this isn't coming and then you can get displaced, or you can get on board, leverage these tools, learn how to use them, take advantage of them. I don't know how to code. I don't know tech. I was way behind, but right now, I've already built my brother a website. I built apps that help increase my productivity here at work. Logos and designs and talk people through things. I'm able to help people in an area where I shouldn't have any experience.

But luckily I was in a position to have someone who guided me. At this point right now, I'm tracing everything back to what it was like when I first started. It was hard, but my uncle was pressing down on me from a high level and forcing me to learn this stuff, forcing me, forcing me, forcing me. Every day I'm playing around with the tools, learning, learning, learning.

Now at this point I help somebody with their business or they have a problem, I'm like, why don't you just do this? You can get around that real quick, you can build this real fast. And I'm like, oh, some people just don't know. They don't know what's possible. And then that starts to throw me off because I'm like, damn, if they don't know what's possible, then they're at a disadvantage and behind the scenes, there's a lot of stuff going on where before they even realize, before they have an opportunity to catch up and get up to speed, the tools are going to be in place and they'll displace them. It just sucks.

So if you're struggling to deal with the learning curve and getting up to speed, just reach out. That's what I'm here to do. I wanna help you understand how to leverage these tools to get yourself up to speed and get ahead. Because if I can go from absolutely nothing to earning over 100K a year applying everything I've learned in the industry that I'm already in, taking myself from fresh out of training to top sales rep year after year, then you can do it too. I'm telling you, you can do it too. Reach out. I'm here to help and just tell me what's going on.

## Key Points

- Two-year transformation: Stone Ages (federal prison, almost 10 years) → 100K+ earnings, top sales rep in district
- Uncle's role: high-level business consultant, brought him in, been playing with AI tools since day of release
- No excuses framing: "If I can master these tools... you can do this too. There's no fucking excuses"
- Industrial revolution reality check: "AI isn't coming. It's already here"—companies leveraging AI to increase efficiency and reduce costs right now
- Homo Deus terror (repeated): Yuval Harari's useless class concept—people displaced by technology who can no longer add value to economy—"I was scared to death. That scared me"
- Prison reading conditions: only had email, everything sent by mail, pen/paper/highlighter, highlighting stuff—still scared despite doing the work
- Still on edge: "If you're not a little on edge about this, then I don't know what to tell you because I'm still on edge about it"—healthy fear persists
- Business reality: "Businesses are in business to generate revenue and add value. AI helps decrease costs, increase productivity and efficiency, and everybody's using it"—if business doesn't use it, they get left behind
- Two options: run around scared/act like it isn't coming and get displaced OR get on board, leverage tools, learn, take advantage
- No coding/tech background: "I don't know how to code. I don't know tech. I was way behind"—but built brother's website, built productivity apps for work, logos, designs, helping people in areas where he shouldn't have experience
- Uncle's pressing: "My uncle was pressing down on me from a high level and forcing me to learn this stuff, forcing me, forcing me, forcing me. Every day I'm playing around with the tools, learning, learning, learning"
- Knowledge gap realization: helping people now and realizing "some people just don't know. They don't know what's possible"—at disadvantage, tools will be in place before they catch up and will displace them—"it just sucks"
- Fresh out of training to top rep year after year: applying AI tools in existing industry, not switching careers—augmentation in current role
- Call to action: struggling with learning curve? Reach out—"That's what I'm here to do. I wanna help you understand how to leverage these tools to get yourself up to speed and get ahead"
