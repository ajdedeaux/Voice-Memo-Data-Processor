# Good-Better-Best King Mattress Strategy - Building Optionality Into the Close

## Transcript

OK, I wanna explain to you what I'm trying to express to one of the guests I just worked with and what I think the best course of action is.

So he came in wanting a new mattress, a king size mattress. Last year he looked at the Posturepedic Highpoint Plus Soft, right? That's what he wanted last year. Now, the model has changed since then, and now the newer model feels a little bit different, but it's still a great mattress. So he wants something nice, something that's going to hold up for a long time. He has some back pain, shoulder pain. He has some pain, right?

So I showed him the Tempur-Pedics, and he ends up really liking the Luxe Breeze, but the price is expensive. I expressed that we could find it maybe an outlet, and he was open to that as well. But now he's kind of on the fence about whether to go with an outlet mattress, a used mattress, or to get it brand new.

Now, I also showed him the Proadapt Medium Hybrid. Now, the Proadapt Medium Hybrid is gonna feel similar to the mattress that he initially came in looking to buy, which is the Posturepedic Highpoint Plush. But it's better quality. The Proadapt Medium Hybrid, the Tempur-Pedic, this is their most popular mattress. This is their most popular, and I think it feels much closer to that feel he was looking for initially. And it's a better quality mattress. Plus the price point on this mattress is about what he could get the Luxe Breeze in outlet in a king. It's about the same price.

So what I'm suggesting and what I would advise is if he's on the fence, and not sure if the outlet option is the way to go and wants to maintain the ability to do a swap and all of that and still keep it at a good price point and get a really good mattress, I would suggest getting the Proadapt Medium Hybrid in king. Sleep on it for that 120 nights and make sure that he likes it, right? And he can try it. So if he doesn't like it, he can swap it. He can exchange it. He can return it even, right?

And I think this would leave him with plenty of options and keep him right at the price point that he wants to be at, or a little bit more than what he initially wanted to be at, but in a better mattress.

And if say if he didn't want to go with the Proadapt, say he doesn't like the Proadapt Medium Hybrid and wants to go to the Luxe Breeze or maybe he's like yeah I love the Tempur-Pedic. I know I love the Luxe Breeze. We can go to an outlet Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze Soft, right? And then he can just get the top of the line mattress in a king at the price point that he initially—at about the same, pretty much the same price.

And let's say he doesn't like the mattress at all. He can return it. Or he could even go down to the Posturepedic Highpoint, the new one, and he'll get the money back in between. So he has a whole bunch of different options available to him.

And I just think that this would be the better option. A good option would be the Highpoint. A better option would be the Proadapt Medium Hybrid. The best option would be Luxe Breeze Soft, right? And going with the one, the good option gives him a lot of options, a lot of just plenty of room to figure it out while still getting an amazing mattress. And he may love this mattress and not want to swap it at all.

So I just want to be able to express this to the customer. So what I want from you is to take all of this, understand everything that I'm trying to say here, and express it back to me in a clean, concise way.

## Key Points

- Customer originally wanted Posturepedic Highpoint Plus Soft from last year—model changed, new version feels different but still great
- Customer has back pain and shoulder pain, wants something nice that will hold up long-term
- Fell in love with Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze but price is expensive—open to outlet option but now hesitant about used vs. brand new
- Proadapt Medium Hybrid recommendation: feels similar to original Posturepedic Highpoint Plush he wanted, better quality, Tempur-Pedic's most popular mattress
- Price strategy: Proadapt Medium Hybrid (new) costs about same as Luxe Breeze (outlet)—same price point, better optionality
- 120-night sleep trial preserves flexibility: can swap, exchange, or return if Proadapt doesn't work—removes risk from decision
- Three-tier strategy clearly articulated: "Good option would be the Highpoint. A better option would be the Proadapt Medium Hybrid. The best option would be Luxe Breeze Soft"
- Upward swap path: if he loves Proadapt but wants Luxe Breeze, can swap to outlet Luxe Breeze Soft at similar price—gets top-of-the-line at original budget
- Downward swap path: if doesn't like it at all, can return or downgrade to new Posturepedic Highpoint and pocket the difference
- Risk mitigation: "He may love this mattress and not want to swap it at all"—Proadapt is most popular for a reason, likely to satisfy
- Maintains customer control: "Leaves him with plenty of options and keep him right at the price point that he wants to be at"
