# This Is Bigger Than the Internet - The $20/Month Intelligence Revolution

## Transcript

So you do realize that this shit is bigger than the Internet, right? And y'all remember the Internet, right? Y'all old enough to remember the Internet, right? Like, all the millionaires and big businesses that exploded from the Internet, right? Yeah. This is bigger than the internet.

But the internet was different because people had to learn a hard skill, which was HTML coding, things like that. But the people that learned those skills created the future that we have right now when it comes to the internet and the way we do business. Those people learned the hard skill, and while it was wide open, they was jumping on it.

Now we have new gatekeepers, new platforms that we all use on a regular basis, like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, these are the platforms that we have to leverage in order to get in front of an audience. Getting in front of an audience is important if you have a business. If nobody knows you exist, nobody can pay you for what you do. But you have to play by their rules because they are the platform, they're where all the people are at. You need to be where everybody is at, so more people know what you do so they can pay you for what you do. You understand what I'm saying?

The good thing, the barrier to entry has never been lowered. To learn this skill. The AI tools give you the ability to take whatever's inside your mind, dump it and translate whatever you have in your mind, whatever language you choose to use, it is able to translate that into different languages. Now let me explain. We're not just talking about English to Spanish. Stop thinking so small.

We're talking about, turn this idea, this concept that I have that's been burning inside of me, turn this concept into a structured business plan. Okay, now take that business plan and turn that into a marketing campaign. Okay, now take that marketing campaign and build me out multiple pieces of content from images to videos to voice to podcasts to whatever. You can literally imagine, it can build this out, right?

So this is the first time in history where intelligence, intelligence is for sale, right? And guess what the cost is? Guess what the cost is? Like 20 bucks a month. You can pay 20 bucks a month for ChatGPT to learn whatever you need to learn. $20 a month. Like, come on now. $20 a month.

In the Wild, Wild West, where everybody's trying to figure this out and get ahead of the curve so they don't turn into a consumer and can become a creator on the new platforms that are going to be the foundational layer of how we do business moving forward. That's the time period we at.

And while you're trying to figure out the prompt to turn yourself into a city girl action figure toy, other people are figuring out how to build agentic systems that connect to each other, are connected to tools, and execute tasks on their behalf, on autopilot. You see the difference?

So I just want everybody to kind of grasp the time period that we're at, and also expand their mind and understand the possibilities that are available to you for $20 a month. $20 a month.

Don't be the person that has to explain to Lil Jimmy when they grow up, what you was doing during the AI wave at the beginning stage. What was you doing? When everybody was—when the AI wave kicked off, what was you doing in 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025. What were you doing? Trying to figure out how to turn myself into a city girl. Come on, man. Come on, man.

## Key Points

- "This shit is bigger than the Internet"—AI represents a larger opportunity than the internet revolution that created millionaires and transformed business
- The internet required hard skills (HTML coding) that created high barriers to entry; those who learned the skills built the future while it was "wide open"
- Current social media gatekeepers (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube) control audience access—you must play by their rules to reach people who can pay you
- AI has lowered the barrier to entry like never before—no hard coding skills required to access intelligence
- Reframe "language translation" beyond English to Spanish: it's about translating concepts into business plans, business plans into marketing campaigns, campaigns into multi-format content (images, videos, voice, podcasts)
- "This is the first time in history where intelligence is for sale"—and it costs $20/month for ChatGPT access
- We're in the "Wild, Wild West" period where people either become creators or consumers of the new foundational business layer
- The contrast: some people use AI for city girl action figure prompts while others build agentic systems connected to tools that execute tasks on autopilot
- Generational accountability moment: "Don't be the person that has to explain to Lil Jimmy what you was doing during the AI wave at the beginning stage"
- Timeline emphasis: 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025—this is the formative period where positions are being established
- The real opportunity is building interconnected agentic systems, not one-off creative outputs
- Mind expansion required: understand the full scope of possibilities available for $20/month, not just surface-level applications
