# 60 Days Out - Mattress Firm Job Landed, But I'm Back on the Bus After the Uber Mistake

## Transcript

What's up y'all, it's June 23rd, ready for another progress report. Got 60 days out and shit's lovely man, it's Gucci. So Gucci, everything good man.

Top goal for the last month has been to get a job at Mattress Firm. Fat boy lined me up. All he asked was, bro, I did my part, just go do your thing, do your part. Yeah. Less than 30 days I went through entire interview process. Got my resume doctored up, my cover letter, got all the thank you letters out, key pieces, followed up, did my research, understood exactly what this company was looking for. And I swear I blew him out the water. And that's not me, you know what I mean, trying to toot my own horn or none of that. That's me speaking from what was relayed back to me through the interview process, every phase of it.

First interview, it's over the phone. Dude told me after the interview, I asked him, so you know, I feel this is a great fit for me. It aligns with where I'm at in my life, my values, my principles. And I feel like it's a good fit. I feel like I could add value to this company. You know, where do you—how do you feel? You know, how do you feel this interview went? And the recruiter Jackson told me straight up, said, man, 2 minutes into the interview I was already moving you on into the next stage. Pure point blank. So he was impressed.

I sent him a thank you letter. I had to look him up on LinkedIn and I just did a lot of following up, built a relationship with the recruiter. He pushed me through to the next phase. As soon as I was able to schedule the interview for the face to face, I did. And again, conducted my research, made sure I did all—went through all of my notes, spoke with my mentor, had some good questions ready for the interview.

And I made sure that, you know, I looked apart, made sure that I was looking professional. And as you can see, I still ain't cut my hair man. I told you I wasn't going to cut my hair. I ain't got to cut my hair for that. You know, but you know sometimes you got to go through the other stuff. You got to blow them away in the other areas to make them just to the point where they can't miss you. You know, they can't ignore you. And that came from all the research and being able to answer their questions.

And when the interview happened, I had a face to face with the hiring man or the store manager as well as a district manager. Then they brought in a training manager as a third wheel. So it was—you know, fresh out of out the joint, you know, that's that was a little intimidating for me. You know, not knowing how this is going to happen, having a lot of—you know, I got a background. I got things that I don't really know if they're going to—if it's going to come out right.

But I studied and I prepared. And when you study and prepare and you do it diligently, you'll be surprised at how well things flow when the clutch moment shows up. It's not like you just jacked up a shot. Now you trained for this. You put it into practice and you worked hard. And in the moment everything just comes out and you shine. And it look easy, it sound easy. You kind of blow yourself away in a sense because you prepared for something much more difficult.

Because you're your own worst critic. You always going to make things harder on yourself or think that it's going to be even more impossible than it is or whatever the case may be. So if you're up against yourself and if you're anything like me, you going to be putting yourself up against a lot. And so you train hard and you may train harder than the people that that is that you're trying to impress or you're trying to get something from—a position, a job, whatever the case may be.

But you train hard and when you get in these situations and things just seem like a laydown for you, it's just a testament to all the work that you put in. And I keep saying all the work I put in or that you put in, but at the end of the day it's about the work that God puts in on you. You know, he going to—if he wants you to succeed, he want to stamp you, he going to stamp you. You think you ready.

And I've been getting blessed man, but I ain't going to lie, I've been slacking all my spirituality. I've been slacking in other areas. But I knocked down goal number uno and I got the job man. Knocked that off the park. I've been working for the last two weeks almost now. So yeah, you know, I'm ahead of the game when it comes to my goals, some of my goals, my top tier goals. I need to do some realignment and reconfiguring and work some things out so that I stay in alignment with, you know, the things that are most important. I don't want to lose touch of that and lose sight of that. That's really what got me here was little things, my spirituality, my contact, my folks, my family, and just keeping a clear mindset.

It's a little bit more difficult out here and I have to admit that. It's a lot—it's a lot going on in the world man. It's fast. It moves fast. But you got to just—you got to try to—you got to stay aligned with what's most important.

So I knocked those goals down. Unfortunately the one thing I'm not proud of is how I manage my finances. I started jumping in Ubers and that took a toll on my bank. That hurt. So bro, I'm walking to the bus right now. I was looking for a car, trying to see if I can go get a car, but I ain't got no credit, no nothing. And I'm not in a position to buy a car. You know, so I got to keep going through the hard stuff, working hard, because I feel like that's going to be—you know, that's what's going to set me apart from the rest. It's going to build more character. It's going to get shot in the high intense moment, set sure to come.

Say so, this where I'm at right now. I'm just going to make this one kind of quick. I know I'm scatter brain. I'm working on that. But that's just a little update and I'm going keep you updated. Right on the bus. Yeah.
