# Catherine & Charles Cayman Islands Deal - The Art of Challenging "I Want the Firmest Mattress" Bias

## Transcript

How to—just come—a guest just came in. Her name was Catherine and she was with her brother Charles. So she immediately comes in and says, "I need the firmest mattress." So I take her over to the Pressure Smart 2.0 Extra Firm. It's a Beautyrest. It's probably the firmest mattress in the store. A traditional innerspring pocketed coils, very firm, I call it the park bench.

So most of the time when someone comes in and they say they want the firmest mattress in the store, I always challenge them. So I take them to the firmest mattress and then have them lay on it. She kind of liked it, thought she did, and I said, okay, cool, let me show you something that's a little comfortable but still supportive. So I showed her the Posturepedic. It's the Sealy Posturepedic Albany 14 inch firm mattress. I showed her that and she laid down on it and surprisingly enough, of course, she was like, "Oh, this is comfortable. I like this." Like, okay, so you like this a little bit better.

So I'm like, okay, can I show you something else? So took her from there. Then I took her to a really high end mattress. I took her to the King's Down Crown Imperial 16 inch firm euro top mattress. Now, this is a really high end, traditional style mattress with a pillow top or a euro top. She laid on that, liked that surprisingly. Her brother tried it as well, didn't like it at first, because he didn't really lay all the way on it. I challenged him after she got up, I said, lay on it all the way. And he laid in it all the way and he's like, "Oh, this is actually pretty comfortable." I'm like, "Okay, so this is a pillow top but still supportive."

So, I'm like, "Okay, now we're here. Let me show you something else." Then I took her to a Purple. I took her to the Rejuvenate. The Purple Rejuvenate. It's in the Luxe collection, and it's the 15.5 mattress. And she tried that, didn't like it, said it was jiggly, too jiggly, didn't like that. And she also said that she sits cross legged at the top of the mattress where the head is, and that's how she reads in her bed. She does yoga, right?

So didn't like that because she said, when she sits at the top of the mattress and reads, she checks to see how her hips feel when she sits in there, and she didn't like the way that felt. So I took her to a lower end mattress, the Sleepy's by Sealy firm. She tried that, didn't like that either. Said it was too jiggly. Then I took her over to the Beautyrest Black Series 3 15 inch firm. Try this. Sat on the top, cross-legged. Actually kind of liked it, but then got out of it and was like, eh, it's okay, but she liked that over the other two, all right?

So then I take her to something different because one of the first things that she said when she walked in is that she does not want anything foam, no foam, that was something that she was really adamant about. So I took her over to this mattress just to challenge her a little bit more. I took her to the Sealy Posturepedic Elite Hybrid Highpoint 2, the 14 inch firm mattress. She laid on this and said, "This is the most supportive mattress that she's tried so far," liked it the best. Cooling, immediately cool to the touch. Didn't feel jiggly. Her brother Charles laid on it next to her just to see if she would feel any movement, liked it. He liked it. So this became their number one pick at this point.

So for me, I'm seeing this and I'm going through it and I'm like, okay, well, if she likes this mattress more than these others, and this has a little bit of memory foam or gel memory foam at the top, I'm opening her up to new things and she's not against it. So she tried this, I said, okay, now you mentioned that you sit cross legged at the top of the mattress, and you read, right? I'm like, "So, I want to show you something that doesn't have anything to do with the mattress. I want to show you something else, but I'm gonna show you this in a mattress that you do not like. It's a Tempur-Pedic, it's a memory foam mattress, but we're not going to talk about the mattress. That's why I want to take you to a mattress that I know you don't like."

Now I do this because most people say they don't like something because of a bias that they already have. And usually when they say they want a firm mattress, when they think of memory foam, they think of a mattress that lacks support and sinks down and causes pain. So I like to challenge people on this, but I need permission first. So as I've taken her to different types of styles and opened her mind to different things, she's slowly saying yes to my recommendations and me guiding her through the process. So I use this point to take her to something else, and I get permission by saying I'mma show her something that has to do with her reading.

So I'm tying this back into something that she said she does in a mattress, and I'm tying it to something else I'm going to show her. So I now have permission to show her something new, and now I tell her that she's not going to like this mattress because it's a memory foam, but I know that. And I reinforce the bias that she says she doesn't like memory foam and I get permission by laying her on something that she claims she doesn't like by showing her something new that could possibly help her.

So I lay her on the Proadapt firm, the Tempur-Pedic Proadapt firm, and as soon as she lays down on it, she's like, wow, this is the softest, most supportive mattress. It doesn't move or anything. I'm like, yeah, now this is a memory foam mattress. It's all foam. I'm like, this is probably one of the most highly returned Tempur-Pedic mattresses, because it's so firm. I'm like, "But I want to show you something different."

So, at this point, I grab the base remote, the Ergo 3.0 and I elevate her feet and explain how this takes pressure off her lower back. I elevate the head slightly, show her how it helps open up her airways, take pressure off her chest, and catch the natural C curve in her back. And then I add the lumbar support in the middle third of the mattress to show her how she can add support in the middle. And then she starts to smile. And this is when I start to see she's really seeing something different, something that she wasn't used to.

And after she lays in there, I'm like, okay, how's this feel? Like, are you comfortable? She said, "Yeah." Like, okay. So what I'm gonna do now, I'm gonna flatten this back out and want you to pay attention to how your body feels. So I flatten it back out. As it flattens back out, I can see the physical discomfort in her face as it flattens back out. And as soon as it flattens back out, she's like, "Oh, my gosh, Charles, you gotta try this."

I'm like, "Any mattress in an adjustable base that adjusts is going to feel much better in this position." I'm like, you can put any mattress on a base like that, but I like to show people that a mattress that you don't find comfortable can still be comfortable by adding some sort of support or elevation in different areas or tweaking the way it lays the mattress.

So, Charles, her brother, jumps into the mattress, and I give him the same demonstration, and I flatten it back out. Same reaction, and he said, "Oh, this is it. This is the difference." He's like, "It's the base." I said, exactly. The base is usually the thing that I see change the way people sleep most drastically. So he's like, "I need to get a base," right? So he has a queen mattress. She was looking for a king, and after some time kind of going back and forth, me explaining how the base operates and how it can sit inside a bed frame, she decided that this was what she wanted. She decided, this is it.

So, from there, she's letting me know now that she lives in the Cayman Islands. Her and her brother both, but they're ordering the mattress here and they're going to have to get it shipped from Miami through a freight cargo thing, right? But she's pulling up pictures of her bed frame, and it sits up pretty high. So she's wondering how it's going to sit, and I'm letting her know that the base, the feet on the base can be adjusted by three inch increments, or they can detach all together and the base can sit flat and act as a low profile style bunkie board, but still make the adjustments and still adjust.

And as I was explaining this, she's still kind of on the fence, doesn't know if it's gonna sit high enough and said that she needs to do some measurements, but this is what she likes. So I gather all her information and her brother's already set. He's going to buy the Ergo 3.0 adjustable base. She wants the base, but she's for sure getting the mattress.

So I write everything up, set the order, and then I gather all their information for the freight pickup from Miami or the drop off to Miami, gather all the information. I gather their phone numbers, but their phone numbers are from the Cayman Islands. So these numbers cannot be texted from our corporate chat line. We can't call the phone numbers. So I let her know that I have to act as her eyes on everything.

So I layout exactly how this will work, set everything up. We get a phone number that we're going to add in from the cargo place or the freight place and we're going to have that delivered and set up or delivered and dropped off. Once she goes, she has to go back home. She's going to be leaving Friday, which is the 22nd and she'll do the measurements. She'll let me know.

I had her pay 10% to hold the pieces and if she wants to drop the base off, we can do that and I'll issue or I'll just drop the base off or remove the base from the ticket. She could pay the difference. But the goal is to get her information to make sure that this is going to be the way she wants, find out if the base is everything, if the base will work, or decide if she can figure out another DIY solution. In the meantime, and then I'm going to have to reach out to her. I got her information, I'll reach out to her through WhatsApp and email. So that's how we'll coordinate everything and I will be the one, the point of contact for her and make sure everything goes smoothly.

And I will upload the order form so you can kind of see everything that's going on. But that's usually how I take somebody away or I challenge somebody's biased opinion about something they think they need, based on incorrect information and just biases. So I usually am able to get people off of a mattress that they thought they wanted and show them something else, and throughout that process, educate them and get them up to speed. And as they try and understand things, they can make better decisions for themselves and I get to layout options and explain things and it usually works out pretty well.

Turned into be a pretty big ticket, built a good relationship with her and her brother, and I'll just be waiting for them to finalize the payment and get me the phone number for the freight company that we can add to the ticket that they can call and then keep eyes on everything and wait for their green light to proceed.
