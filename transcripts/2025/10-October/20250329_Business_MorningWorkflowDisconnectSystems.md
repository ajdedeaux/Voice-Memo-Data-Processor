# The Morning Routine of a Top Performer - And Why the Systems Are Driving Me Insane

## Transcript

OK, I'm gonna talk you through my morning. So on the way into work, I spent the whole time trying to prompt Claude and ChatGPT on how to build and build out a new app that will increase my overall efficiency and eliminate busy work and capture my methodologies and systems and processes real time and make my job easier and transform the way I work. So I did that through my commute. That's the time I used to either listen to podcasts or get some work done, think through things and stuff like that.

Now I just pulled up, got in, opened the shop, came in, and I put out an advertising board thing right in front of the door to kind of market it and get some people, draw some attention to the store, etcetera. Came and sat down, and the first thing I do was open up my apps and my operating system we use to take orders or place orders. And that's where we can see inventory and that's where I hunt through inventory and things like that, right?

And then I open up the apps, I log in, clock in, and now, one of the first things I do is open up our CRM type of system, where we capture new customers information, walk them through, do sleep assessments, capture their information, name, and all that key information stuff, right? And this is where I can build out packages and quotes or build out packages, and then I send it over to the order processing system. Right? So that's what I open up, open that.

And then I open up my email, my Teams. I really don't check my email or my Teams right away. One of the first things I do is open up my pay. And I want to see how much I'm getting paid right away. Like, where is my money at? How much money have I made? I want to know. So I open this up first, check my pay, wanna make sure that I'm getting paid and that things are in order. Opening it now. Opening up my pay. Cool. So I'm already at $6,000 for a two week period. Great.

So that means that some of the orders that went out yesterday, either got finalized, whatever happened. So I'll need to go through and look at all the orders that we're going through, and then I'll need to go into my system. And I'll need to go back and forth to check which one is which is very time consuming and it's frustrating because it's not easy to see where I'm getting paid, which ones got paid. It doesn't—they don't correlate. This one system shows this, the other system shows that. I don't have a way to copy and paste to find out what the order number is. It's just really clunky and stupid. I hate it so much. I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it.

The next thing I open up is Podium. Podium is where I work a lot of the time. I'm always in Podium. That's where I can send out text messages and follow ups and things like that directly to the customers, text only system. And this is where I can see if someone shot me a message. I can see if somebody's looking for something. I can also see what's going on in the entire district and I can see if maybe somebody reached out and looking for something and I can jump on that quick before anybody else and I'll get credit for it. So I can do that.

So I open that up, check everything. Sometimes I'll have notes saved in there, like an internal note within Podium. So I can see and catch up on, you know, get an overview of what I'm using or what's being done or what's going on with this customer. Because the tracking system—when I create a new profile for a customer, there's a note system, but that doesn't capture what happens in Podium and all the text messages and stuff I sent. So I have to do rework all the time where I'll have to go here and then transfer it back.

Or if I'm in Podium and I have a customer, I have to remember their name or their phone number or their order number to even pull them up because it doesn't scroll down long enough for me to see all the people I've interacted with. And if there's a customer that calls in that's not mine, I'll take that customer. I'll pull up their profile and then now that gets pushed down and then the customers that I am working with get lost.

So sometimes I'll go to Podium, I'll send people a quick digital business card or a follow-up information, but sometimes people are busy and then I'm using Podium to also reach out to other people that aren't my customers and follow-ups and stuff like that. And then hot leads that I had, relationships that I had built get pushed down and I lose them, and I forget about them. And I have to scroll through a million different text messages and things that are going out just to find somebody. And then if somebody picks that up and then puts it in their name, I can't track it.

Like it's so frustrating and I hate losing good leads because I know I can get people to buy. And this is where I optimize time, where it may be dead in the store and no traffic in the store. So I have no one to talk to, no one to sell. And now I'm working on follow-ups and I'm working on nurturing different leads and guiding people through and those types of things. I could send links and I can do all of that, but if I miss it or something gets lost, then that lead is lost forever. They might step back into a store while I'm at another store working, someone else gets that up, they sell that customer and I lost it. I just hate that.

So I open that system and I kind of go through and try to catch up on stuff. Then I open up my leaderboard and I want to see where the hell I am on the leaderboard because that drives me. I want to see who's performing, who's not. I want to see where my metrics are. I want to make sure that I'm at the top of all the metrics. I love this. This is where I love this hunt and I'm running people down.

If I'm at the top of the district in my area, I get frustrated, so I'll open it up and I want to look at the other districts and I want to look at the entire market, and then I want to look at the entire company as a whole. Like, how do I measure up against all the best people if I'm the best in my current district or whatever, right? So I'm going through, I want to track my metrics and I'm looking at all of that, all the numbers, all the data. This is where I'm crunching data and I'm looking to see where I need to improve or where I'm shining or what's what. Cause I wanna make sense of all this data and I wanna see how to get better and where I'm at, right?

And right now, I'm still top of the district here. I'm at $122,000 for this period. And the next person up is at $98,000. So I am blowing a lot of people out of the water right now. I do this consistently. I'm usually at the top. It'd be weird if I wasn't at the top. I would feel weird. Like there must be something going wrong.

But yeah, I'm at the top and the next person that's $98,000, the person below him is at $83,000, and then $82,000, $76,000, $73,000, $63,000, $62,000, $61,000, $59,000, $58,000. And that's one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. So out of 11 people, you can see there's a big drop off. It goes from around, for me, $122K all the way down within the top 10 to somebody at like $60K. So that's a big jump. I'm doubling what the person at the bottom of the top ten is doing. And I love that. And I want to track that. I want that to be part of my brag bag. I want that to be proven metrics, right? I want that to be shown.

My gross per adjustable base, this is a key metric for me because I don't think people show adjustable bases like they should. I'm at my gross base cost average is $555. And most people are at like $260 and these are top performers. $260, $399. Let's see if there's anybody that's higher up. There's somebody who has like $463. Here's someone, $581. And he kind of got lucky. His manager told me he kind of got lucky on some of that. Another person is at $505. But most people are at like $100 to $300, average about $300, $400 per base.

I sell big bases, I sell big tickets, I focus on that, I build value in the expensive items. So I am also—my accessory attachment. So like sheets, pillowcases, all the little accessories, things that really have higher margins. I sell those, right? So I'm at 129% in that metric. The next highest person is—here's somebody that's higher than me. Let me make sure this isn't someone that's a part timer that doesn't ever come in. And of course it is.

So she's at 133%, but I usually can see numbers pretty quickly, like 133%—who are you? You're never—there's usually nobody else beating me out in this metric. So 133%, she's a part timer, she comes in randomly and only has to sell a little bit. For instance, she only has sold 11 beds. I've sold 48. So our numbers aren't the same. Once she averages out, hers will go down. Anyways, let's see. So another person who's doing well and this is the highest person is at like 103%. And everybody else is not on the map. Right?

So that's what I do. I hunt through that and now my next thing I'm going to do is I am going to look through my orders and see what's important and then start working on that. So that's how my morning goes. This is how I kind of optimize everything, how I kind of get the gears rolling. And that's my system. That's my operating environment. That is how I kind of set my environment up. And I just want to share that with you right now so you understand what it looks like to be a top performer, what my workflow is like, and now I'm gonna go and try to get some money, try to make some sales, do some follow-ups.

## Key Points

- Commute productivity: entire drive spent prompting Claude and ChatGPT to build app that will "increase overall efficiency, eliminate busy work, capture methodologies and systems and processes real time"
- Opening routine: advertising board outside, then opens apps/systems
- System 1 - Order processing/inventory: where he hunts through inventory
- System 2 - CRM: captures customer info, sleep assessments, builds packages/quotes, sends to order processing system
- **Pay check first, always**: "One of the first things I do is open up my pay. I want to see how much I'm getting paid right away. Where is my money at? How much money have I made?"—$6K for two-week period currently
- **System disconnect pain point**: "I'll need to go back and forth to check which one is which is very time consuming and it's frustrating because it's not easy to see where I'm getting paid, which ones got paid. They don't correlate. This one system shows this, the other system shows that. I don't have a way to copy and paste to find out what the order number is. It's just really clunky and stupid. I hate it so much. I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it"
- **Podium (text/follow-up system)**: where he works "a lot of the time. I'm always in Podium"—text messages, follow-ups, can see entire district activity, jump on leads quick
- **Podium-CRM disconnect**: CRM note system doesn't capture what happens in Podium—"I have to do rework all the time where I'll have to go here and then transfer it back"
- **Lost leads problem**: Podium doesn't scroll down long enough to see all interactions—if he takes someone else's customer call, his hot leads get pushed down—"relationships that I had built get pushed down and I lose them, and I forget about them"
- **Lead theft risk**: "If somebody picks that up and then puts it in their name, I can't track it. It's so frustrating and I hate losing good leads because I know I can get people to buy"
- **Dead time optimization**: when store is dead, works on follow-ups and nurturing leads via Podium—but lost leads = lost forever if they walk into another store and another rep gets them
- **Leaderboard obsession**: "I want to see where the hell I am on the leaderboard because that drives me"—checks district, then other districts, then entire market, then entire company
- **Current standings**: $122K for period, next person at $98K, bottom of top 10 at $60K—"I'm doubling what the person at the bottom of the top ten is doing"—top of district consistently, would feel weird if not
- **Adjustable base metric**: average gross per base $555 (most top performers at $260-$400)—"I don't think people show adjustable bases like they should. I sell big bases, I sell big tickets, I focus on that, I build value in the expensive items"
- **Accessory attachment metric**: 129% (next highest full-timer at 103%, part-timer at 133% but only 11 beds sold vs. his 48)—"sheets, pillowcases, all the little accessories, things that really have higher margins"
- **Brag bag mentality**: "I want that to be part of my brag bag. I want that to be proven metrics. I want that to be shown"
- Morning routine purpose: "So you understand what it looks like to be a top performer, what my workflow is like"
