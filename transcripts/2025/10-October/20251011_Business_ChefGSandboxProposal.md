# The Chef G Sandbox - Escaping Corporate Gatekeepers to Build Real AI Proof

## Transcript

OK, I keep trying to figure out how I can practice what I'm learning with all this AI tech, and with a company. The problem I'm having is—and I feel like the team has is—when it comes to the companies that we're trying to work for or work with, they are big enterprise companies, big corporations and they have all these freaking gatekeepers and they move so slow and their teams are so big and it's like we can't get anything done because we have to like, and then we can't use their name. We can't do anything, right?

But my brother, Chef G, has a company called Chef G Events. He's a private chef—well, he's an executive chef at a restaurant that he took from going under to being established as one of the go-to spots in Sacramento. It's super popular and highly Instagrammable. Everybody takes pictures of all the food and they share and it's great. He's transitioned into private catering events and he does the most amazing work. Like if you just look at his Instagram with all the videos and the happy people that he serves and just, he has an audience and it's him, his daughter, and then a lot of the servers from the restaurant that he works. And then his other daughter is now coming in.

Now, his website was—he's a doer. He is a doer and he's gifted, but he's not techie, but he is just hands-on gonna get it done. He's recognized as the goat in the industry in his section, in his area. Nobody's doing it like him. They can't put together the product or the showcase, they can't do it the way he does it. He has more people asking for his service on days that he can't fulfill it than he does—he hasn't been able to scale because he hasn't scaled himself.

Now what I'm proposing to our team at Analytics AIML, where we are an AI strategy company, AI implementation company with a team of, I don't know, seven to ten people, all with different unique skill sets around implementing AI, like SEO, AEO, GEO, project management consulting, Lean Six Sigma process improvement, sales, content creation, image generation, RAG, data analysis—like we have a whole team, right, but we don't have a sandbox of playing. We're trapped inside these corporate structures where we can't make any decisions without getting approval.

I'm suggesting that we take on my brother's business and take him from where he's at and turn it into a $1 million company. His business can turn into a $1 million dollar company. And my suggestion and my thinking on this, and the thing I want to emulate is I want to take Alex Hormozi's process that he's used to scale Gym Launch and apply that same type of principle to private catering events where he can take highly trained specialized chefs who are in a position where they want to grow and run their own show or start their own business or do their own catering events. And we build out a playbook based on his success, package it and sell it, and we call to those chefs who are ready to do something else and basically give them the frameworks that they need to build out a business similar to his because he's proving that he can do it and he has a success and then it's his business.

So we get a few things here. Number one, and I think most importantly, is the ability to take everything that he does and without approval or any extra guardrails or gatekeepers, we get to—all we have to do is reach out to him or just reach out to me and I reach out to him and get a green light or we pretty much have a sandbox where we can just play with it. We can post, we can talk about what we're building with his business because all of that is content. All of that are things that we can literally speak to and we can use the names and it can be real and we can show it. We can show the success. We can show where he's at now and then start implementing these different tools into his workflow, build out his process and show where he goes from where he's at now into a $1 million dollar company.

And we have the ability to turn him from a single operator to basically a scaled operator who basically trains others to do what he does, set up workshops, different things. But by doing that, we also as a team train these individuals on how to use these AI tools to get where they want to go. It is wide open. Nobody's doing that. Who's teaching chefs to use AI systems and tools using the seven AI capabilities to transform their current role into a business that scales?

And then so we have layers of success. We have the business where it's at that already has a proven model that works. We plug in AI tools and we scale it and then all of the success, we track all the metrics, all the success we scale it into a million dollar company. That means everybody behind is our client base and every one of us becomes adept, skilled and proficient in building out these solutions for a business. Every one of these clients we can serve—so we serve this type of client. We serve master chefs who are looking to scale their brilliance into a $1 million entity or $1 million dollar business, right? Something like that.

All of us can play around, we can use these tools as our case study, and then everything that we build—now we have proof that this works. Like if we can take this and then make $1 million dollars out of it, then we're good.

Now he's gonna need a few things as a business, right? He's gonna need more employees. He's gonna need a better website. He's gonna need better visibility online. He's gonna need systems and tracking systems and tools and analytics and capture, and then SOPs and documentation built in. And all of that data needs to be built with AI-first capabilities so that with agentic behavior in mind and then we need to build agents that handle much of the process. We need to create content. We need to plug in agent workflows and we need to build out process improvement and do deep research. Like we need to leverage all the seven AI capabilities that we promote and that we push in order to scale his business.

And then we have the green light to do it without any fricking pushback because as fast as we can build it, he can knock it out. And he's brilliant. We can count on him to execute. So like right now we're coming into the holiday season. How do we get him a $10,000 deal, right? How do we get him—like his biggest sale is probably like 5,000 or something like that. How do we get him a $10,000 sale? How do we show that his service is worth $10,000 right? And then we scale that.

That is my proposal to the team and this will help me because right now my frustration is that I work at Mattress Firm. I can't just use their name and plug in different tools. I can't call any APIs into inventory or tracking of the trucks, all the pain points that I have, I can't even begin to plug in to solve with any agents or anything like that. And then I can't just say certain things and bash the company—and not bash them, but I can't just speak on certain things and inefficiencies that I see because it feels like I'm giving insider information. I don't know.

And I also am not adept enough in implementing these solutions with these skills to have conversations with corporate executives or gatekeepers to show that I have the proficiency to get something done. I also don't have anything behind me that says, yeah, I took this company to a million dollars. Like now that gives anybody—it doesn't matter—it gives them like oh I should listen to this guy cause he did something with what he has, right?

And then it also gives me—it gives me that bold cocky confidence, almost like, no, you need to listen to me. Like, it allows us to speak like our mentor, Frank. He is able to speak the way he does because he's speaking from a place of confidence. He's speaking from a place of I've done this before. I am a subject matter expert. I am an authority in this. I've been doing this for years. I get results, right? That's authority. And as a consultant, you need to have that tone in your voice and it needs to be unshakable and it needs to be backed and proven through success based on merit, based on actual proven results that you've been able to implement on your watch, not hypothesis or understanding how to use something, actually plugging it in and watching revenue drip.

So that's my suggestion, and that's what I want to work on. So I want to package up—I don't know, if somebody has a great idea and they need to build it out, like, what do the best smartest intelligent people right now? What do they do to present something like this to a team? What do they do to get all the information that they need to prove that this idea is worth pursuing? What type of assets need to be built to prove this and back it up?

And most importantly, what I need you to do is look at—think about my mentor, our founder, the top consultant in our company who has all the subject matter expertise, who fully understands this stuff as a business consultant. He is the person that will kill this deal if he's the final say and he's the one that can kill this deal. What needs to be laid out to make sure that all he can do is say yes?

Things that he doesn't like or are things that he's more concerned about is there's no money in this, right? Where's the money at? Like, okay, that's cool, but we have projects where there's like hundreds of thousands of dollars, and he's like, really about time and do we have the time or are we spending our wheels here? Like, that's cool, but the money's here. Like, we need to learn how to implement this for this. We need to solve for corporations and then we can go get the other stuff later on. So he's looking at it from that perspective.

But I think that our entire team will grow faster with a sandbox that is also tied to revenue and I feel like we can take my brother's business and turn it into a million dollar business like right away and we have all the tools. We have everything that we need to play around with them.

## Key Points

- Core problem: Analytics AIML team trapped in corporate structures with gatekeepers, slow decision-making, inability to use client names or implement freely—can't practice or prove AI skills
- Chef G has proven product-market fit: took restaurant from failing to Instagram-famous Sacramento destination, recognized as "the goat" in his area, more demand than capacity to fulfill
- Proposal: Apply Alex Hormozi's Gym Launch model to private catering—scale Chef G from single operator to $1M business, then package and sell playbook to other specialized chefs
- "Most importantly, the ability to take everything that he does without approval or any extra guardrails or gatekeepers—we have a sandbox where we can just play with it"
- All work becomes publishable content: can show real metrics, use real names, document transformation from current state to $1M—nothing is restricted or insider info
- Multi-layered success model: scale the proven business with AI tools, train the team on implementation, create replicable client service model for master chefs wanting to scale
- "Who's teaching chefs to use AI systems and tools using the seven AI capabilities to transform their current role into a business that scales?"—untapped market
- Chef G needs: more employees, better website, online visibility, tracking systems, analytics, SOPs, documentation—all built AI-first with agentic behavior
- Immediate goal: get Chef G a $10,000 holiday season deal (currently ~$5,000 max) to prove value scaling works
- Mattress Firm limitations: can't use company name, can't call APIs, can't speak on inefficiencies without feeling like insider trading, zero implementation freedom
- Missing credibility piece: "I also don't have anything behind me that says, yeah, I took this company to a million dollars"—need proof to speak with authority
- Frank (mentor) speaks with "bold cocky confidence" because he has proven results—"actual proven results that you've been able to implement on your watch, not hypothesis"
- Anticipated objection from founder: "Where's the money at? We have projects with hundreds of thousands of dollars"—focus is on corporate deals, not small business sandbox
- Counter-argument: entire team grows faster with revenue-tied sandbox where they can actually implement freely and build proof
