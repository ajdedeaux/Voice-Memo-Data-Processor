# Kevin & Dina Split King - Coordinating a Cross-State Sale Without Losing the Deal

## Transcript

All right, so today I had a customer come in, his name is Kevin, and older gentleman looking to get—you know what he called his half of the mattress, so he's gonna get a king, a split king and he wanted something firm. Showed him a few mattresses. He did not like the traditional innerspring coil mattresses, had him try a Beautyrest Black firm. He wasn't a big fan of it. I had him try the Tempur-Pedic Lux Breeze firm. He wasn't a big fan of it. He kind of moves—he moves around a lot while he sleeps. I saw him like moving from his back to his side. And I noticed that while he was in the Tempur-Pedic, he was kind of, you know, slow to be able to move around in that mattress.

So I took him to the hybrid, the Sealy Posturepedic Highpoint Elite. I had him try the firm, which he liked and then he tried the medium and he was actually surprised that he liked the medium as well, but for him, he felt like the firm was the best choice. So then I showed—he wanted to see more hybrids and I ended up showing him Purple. So I showed him the Purple Restore Plus Cool Touch. He actually was surprised that he liked it. So he ended up staying between those two mattresses. For him, he hasn't really decided yet, but he liked the Sealy Posturepedic Elite Highpoint firm and the Purple Restore Plus Cool Touch.

He is going to be moving in and wants everything moved in around the 20th or 27th, something like that. But before his wife comes into town and she is in Wisconsin right now, and she'll be moving in. She'll be coming in on October 31st. So he wants to have everything all set up. They purchased a bed frame. We took a look at the bed frame, and they're going to need box springs. He said they kind of wanted to be higher, so we ended up going with the nine inch box springs.

And now the only thing we need to do is find out which mattress his wife Dina—D-I-N-A—which mattress Dina likes. So in order to do this and this is important because I don't wanna lose this sale or have to split it with somebody else. I don't want the customer to even have to think about it, but I want to lay everything out and map everything out for her to make it really easy for her to go in and find out what she likes.

So she's in Wisconsin. I already looked up the Mattress Firm in that area and called the store manager. Her name is Kayla Pruitt and she let me know that this Mattress Firm has like the widest selection in the area and the most mattresses. So this is going to be good. She'll be able to go in there and kind of test the mattresses out, find out which one she likes best, and then I'll be able to coordinate everything here from Tampa and pull everything from our local warehouse and stay on top of the delivery and watch over everything and make sure that everything is delivered and installed before her arrival on the 31st.

So, all we need from her is to go in and explore some options. I want to lay out the options that Kevin tried, so she knows what he tried and liked. One thing to kind of keep in mind, I'm not sure if it's a huge deal for them, but they essentially both get to pick whichever mattress they like. But because they'll be next to each other, the only thing that I possibly can see is like being a potential drawback to certain mattresses over the others is the height difference. Now, we can compensate and fix this based on box springs. So we have, like, nine inch box springs, five inch box springs, three inch box springs, things like that. So, if she chooses a mattress that is taller or shorter than the one that Kevin has, then we may just adjust the box spring to make sure it is as close to flush as possible.

Now, for her, I just want to kind of maybe lay out a few things for her to keep in mind while she's shopping and exploring options. There's like three styles of mattress. I call the traditional mattress, the one with the innerspring pocketed coils, the hotel style—so anything with those tufts or dead giveaways that it's a traditional mattress and has a coil-based structure. You'll feel more like you're on top of the mattress. You have some bounce to it. And if she likes a softer mattress, she may want to look at pillow tops, mattresses with pillow tops. Some good options to try would be the Beautyrest Black and the Stearns and Foster. Those are really, really nice mattresses. I love them. They're going to hold up for a very long time. They're very comfortable, durable, made with quality materials. Going to have all the cooling capabilities and comfort and all that.

Now, the all foam mattresses are going to be things like Tempur-Pedic. So if she wants something that conforms and kind of allows her to sink into place and still get the support and pressure relief that she needs, Tempur-Pedic is a great option, but you will feel like you're inside of the mattress more so than on top. Now, I don't want her to feel like the Tempur-Pedic is going to be bad just because she feels like she's inside of the mattress. That material is like a five star type of foam, and it will continue to come back time and time again. Have many customers who have come in, have had Tempur-Pedic for 20 years and if that's something that she feels comfortable in, I don't want her to be worried that her back pain will flare up. And I also want her to be aware that she has 120 night sleep trial to make sure that it's the mattress that she wants. And if something doesn't feel right or she's experiencing pain or discomfort, she can always reach out and I will swap out a mattress for her through that 120 night sleep trial. And we'll come out and swap it out on the spot as long as there's no rips, stains or tears on it.

Now, that's all foam. That's another style. Now, there's also hybrids. A hybrid is going to be a combination of the two. It's going to have a coil based structure for support and some sort of comfort materials on the top. That's just a balanced type of feel. Now, Kevin preferred the hybrid style. That was the style that he liked and felt most comfortable in. But that may not be the same case for her.

So, some good hybrid options are going to be the one that Kevin liked, the Highpoint, the Posturepedic Highpoint, the Purple Restores, and Tempur-Pedic also has hybrid options as well. Anything—not anything but the Proadapt Medium Hybrid is one of Tempur-Pedic's most popular mattresses. And the Lux Breeze Medium Hybrid is a good hybrid that's going to give you cooling and still give you that hybrid type of feel with coils in it. There's also the ProBreeze model as well. So those are a few options.

And then also let her know, like to try the Purples, those are hybrids. They feel different, but make sure that you give them a try. Because if—if she has pain, which I think Kevin had mentioned—or I don't know if she has, let's not say she has pain because I don't know if she does, but if she does have pain, Purple does a really good job at helping with spinal alignment. And if she sleeps hot, Purple also is built on that grid and that grid is going to keep her nice and cool because there's nothing—no nothing traps heat.

So I think Purple if she's a hot sleeper, Purple is a great option to explore. But this is all based on comfort preference and these are just some helpful tips and guidelines to kind of think about as she's shopping for a mattress. Also, if she can, you know, try to find, make sure to try the mattress in the sleep position, in the position she sleeps in to get a good idea of what she's going to like. If she sleeps on her side, then pay attention to your shoulders and your hips because those are going to be the major pressure points. Try to just pay attention to how that feels and then if you notice any discomfort or pain or anything at all, that's an immediate sign that it's not going to be the right mattress for you.

If she has any questions, any questions at all, she can reach out and I can answer the phone and kind of talk her through anything. Or if she has a sleep expert in the store, they can help. I spoke with Kayla. I'm not sure if she'll be there tomorrow or when she's able to go in, but I will leave all the information for the store, the manager's name and I'll put notes into the system that get anybody up to speed so they know what to look for and what mattresses maybe to show her and anybody can get up to speed. All she has to do is give them her phone number and have them pull up her profile.

And then once she understands which mattress she wants, all she has to do is let me or Kevin know and I'll handle the rest. Outside of that, I think that's good. I want to see this kind of structured out properly. Take all of this and build structure into this to make it simple. I'll add in for any mattress, then just leave some room. You don't have to guess what mattress. Just put like a name and then leave space for me or I'll plug in information for all the mattresses next.

## Key Points

- Kevin (older gentleman) came in for split king, wanted firm, moves around a lot while sleeping—observed him shifting from back to side during testing
- Kevin disliked traditional innerspring coils, Beautyrest Black firm, and Tempur-Pedic Lux Breeze firm (too slow to move around in the memory foam)
- Kevin narrowed down to two hybrids: Sealy Posturepedic Highpoint Elite firm and Purple Restore Plus Cool Touch
- Wife Dina is currently in Wisconsin, arriving Tampa October 31st—needs to have everything delivered and installed before her arrival (targeting 20th-27th)
- "This is important because I don't wanna lose this sale or have to split it with somebody else"—proactive cross-location coordination to protect the commission
- Called Wisconsin Mattress Firm, spoke with store manager Kayla Pruitt—confirmed widest selection in area, will put notes in system for anyone to access via phone number lookup
- Height difference challenge: split king allows each person to choose different mattresses, but may create uneven bed height—solution is adjusting box spring heights (9", 5", 3" options)
- Three mattress style education framework: Traditional (on top, bounce, pillow tops like Beautyrest Black/Stearns & Foster), All Foam (inside mattress, conforms, Tempur-Pedic with 20-year longevity), Hybrid (balanced, coils + comfort materials)
- Kevin preferred hybrids—but emphasized Dina may have different preferences, needs to test herself
- Hybrid recommendations for Dina: Sealy Posturepedic Highpoint, Purple Restore, Tempur-Pedic Proadapt Medium Hybrid (most popular), Lux Breeze Medium Hybrid, ProBreeze
- Purple-specific selling points: spinal alignment for pain, grid structure doesn't trap heat for hot sleepers
- Sleep position testing guidance: side sleepers focus on shoulder/hip pressure points—any discomfort is immediate disqualifier
- 120 night sleep trial safety net: can swap out if pain/discomfort occurs, as long as no rips/stains/tears
- Will coordinate everything from Tampa, pull from local warehouse, manage delivery timeline—Dina just needs to test and communicate preference
