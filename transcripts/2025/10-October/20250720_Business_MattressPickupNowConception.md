# MattressPickupNow.com Origin Story - From Messy Brain Dump to Functioning Prototype

## Transcript

OK, for this entire app, basically what it's doing is taking everything that I would do as, I don't know, a salesperson knowing the industry and what's possible. And I would just—I just need to reverse engineer my process of going about solving the problem. All right? So I'm just gonna talk you through how it would go if I found somebody with this specific need.

Okay, here's the need. Somebody is in urgent need of a mattress. They need it right now. It could be a variety of different reasons why they need it right now. Maybe they just moved into town and they forgot to grab a mattress. They're looking for something right now. They already got the spot, they got the keys, but they don't have a bed. Maybe their bed frame just came in. Now they're looking for a mattress. Maybe an accident happened, and they need a new mattress. Something with a dog, anything. The kid peed on it, things like that. Maybe they have guests coming into town. Maybe their kid is now coming home from college. Or their kid is moving into college and moving out and into their own place for the first time or going to college. Maybe they just need to furnish a guest bedroom, maybe their child is now ready for their first big kid bed. Maybe there was an emergency or a flood, or something like that. Maybe they need to furnish an Airbnb or a rental property.

The thing is, most of these situations are going to be quick, simple solutions to a problem that they're beginning to find to be overwhelming once they start to look. Because finding a mattress and searching for a mattress becomes overwhelming with all the information that comes at them. So this whole process is designed to simplify and streamline and give them direct answers to four quality options that they can choose from that can be picked up in a store nearby right now or in a local warehouse that is close to them.

They don't have to worry about freaking out to find out that the mattress isn't what they like because they can try the mattress in the store when they buy it. If they like it, they can load it up in the car and leave with it. It will fit on the back of the seat of the car. It doesn't need—it's not going to go in the trunk. If they have an SUV with the seats that fold down in the back, cool, it'll fit there, but it will also fit in a Prius in the back seat, laid on top of the seats.

That is the wow factor. That is the aha moment. That is the thing that people don't realize is possible, and then they don't realize that they can actually try it first and then buy it and then have it loaded up and then take it home, unpack it, and sleep on it tonight. That is the solution, that is the streamlined solution to the problem that they have.

Now, we found the ideal client. There is urgency, there's need, and we have the solution, and they found us. What happens next?

Well, for me, the first thing I would do is if I'm talking to them, I would ask them, okay, where are you at? I need to know what your location is, because right now, I need to find the closest location to you and check availability of options that are near you or closest to you. So you can head over there and pick the one you want and make sure it's the one you want and then just have it loaded up. But I don't want to waste your time. And especially if you need it right now tonight. So I'm gonna ask some questions.

Where are you located? The more precise answer I get, the better. The other thing is like, okay, maybe where they're located right now isn't where they want the mattress. So it's more about where do you want to pick up the mattress? What's most convenient for you? They could very well be shopping and trying to decide which option is best, but want their son or daughter or child or whatever to pick it up in their new location where their home is. So there's a couple different options there, right? So you have to think creatively and you have to think about all the different scenarios.

So you want to know, okay, who is this mattress for? Where is it going? And you need to understand, okay, you need it right now. Cool, I need to know what your location is, where you're at, and then I'm gonna find inventory to see if there's inventory nearby. Once I understand where they're at and how many locations I have nearby, I can find inventory and then I can direct them.

So I'm gonna need to know what size mattress they need, right? And then sometimes people don't fully understand what mattress sizes are. So understanding the actual square inches of a mattress and the dimensions could be valuable information. Usually if it's a college student going into a college dorm, those are twin XL mattresses. If it's a child's bedroom, it's usually a twin. If it's a small bedroom, it's usually a full. If it's a regular sized room, it's probably a queen. If it is a large room, master bedroom, or something, usually a king. Two twin XL mattresses equal a king, and that's what is called a split king. So understanding that information is important.

Now, these are cost effective solutions, so usually people are going to be looking for cost. Cost is going to be the major needle mover. Now, the other thing is, who's sleeping on the mattress and for how long? How long is this solution going to need to hold up for, right? People understand that if an option is less expensive, it's probably not gonna hold up for a long period of time or as long as something more expensive. And maybe it won't be as comfortable either, but it doesn't seem like this is really the reason that they're shopping. They're shopping to solve a problem.

So understanding the why. We need to know where they're at, what size mattress they need, who it's for, or what room it's going for, what's the occasion, what's the situation, what's the urgency level? And like the why? We need to understand why. And then from there, we can say, and then we need to understand the budget, right? Like, okay, so how much are you expecting to pay?

Usually $199 to, I would say, around 850, but it'll be under $1,000. Options usually that we're gonna be focusing on are gonna be anywhere from $199—and this all depends on size—$199 to $1000 bucks or under, right? That's where we're going to try to focus on. And then we're going to try to find immediate availability.

So mattress in a box. There's four options. I only want to focus on these four options to bring them in, right? Do you like a firmer mattress? Do you like something in the middle, a medium? Or do you like a soft plush mattress? Or do you like something that is a combination of support and coils with memory foam? That'll be a hybrid. So hybrids are popular. So you have firm memory foam, medium memory foam, plush memory foam and medium hybrid. Those options will usually be available in most sizes in a store nearby, pickup fast.

Now, the most popular is the medium memory foam mattress. Most popular, most people find it very comfy. It's all they need. They're gonna love it. If you need something low profile that's super low that'll go in a trundle or it's for a child, you want something with a solid kind of more firm, you can go with a firm memory foam, but it's only eight inches. The medium is 10 inches. The plush is 12 inches, but the plush is very soft. So if you like a really soft mattress, a real comfy mattress, the plush is the option. Now, the medium hybrid is going to be a good balance, but it's going to be about 10 inches. All right? They all fit in the box. These are all options that should be available right away wherever they're at.

Usually, I would recommend saying, hey, you're probably, if you don't know and you want to make sure that you have something that works for everybody, I would either go the medium memory foam, or the medium hybrid. Those are going to be two great options. All right?

Once I provide those two recommendations, I will try to find, then I will want to gather more information from the user or from the person I'm on the phone with. Okay, what's your first and last name? Great. What's your phone number? Cool. What's your email? Okay, I'm going to build a quick profile for you and I'm going to get ahead of this. I'm going to reach out to the nearest location. I'm going to put in a special offer for you. It's going to be free pickup or you can have it delivered, but usually they want it right now. If you can get either free delivery or you can go pick it up right now.

Usually delivery, I can be like next day, if it's before 2 o'clock or it could be maybe two days out. But usually right away. If the options are not available in the surrounding stores nearby, we can usually send them to a local warehouse where they can pick up anything.

So, after understanding all of that, we'll want to gather their information. Okay, name, phone number, email address, and then physical address for where their mattress is gonna go because you're gonna have a warranty attached to it, but you're also going to want to have the location nearest to you. Your location right now, where you want to pick it up. So either a zip code or a precise location or a physical address, maybe they're at work or something like that, and they want to find something close to their job, or they want to send their child in to go try it wherever they're at.

So you'll want to uncover, where do you want to go try this out? What's the most convenient? And then let them know, hey, I got options. I can find the nearest location to your job. If you're at work right now and you want to go when you get off work. And then you want to double check and say, okay, here are some options nearby, and these are the hours of operation. So you can pull up at this time or that time, right?

And then from there, once you gather all of their information, then you let them know, okay, we're putting this together right now, we're going to get all the instructions together, we're going to make sure that the options are available near you, and then we're going to send you the directions to the place where that's going to be closest to you, where you can pick up one of these options. And then from there, they'll wait to hear back. And then that would be the whole process.

Once they decide that's what they want, I would build four quotes for each of the options in the size that they wanted and then I would have that in the system and then as soon as they go to the location, they just give their phone number and their whole order will pop up. They can try the options, pick one they want, pay for it, walk out. Very easy.

Another option could be if they already know they want the medium memory foam and they just need something right now or they know exactly what they want, be like, cool, great. I'm going to put this all together and I'll send you a link to pay. You can pay for it now. It'll hold the mattress right now and take it out of inventory. You can go pull up at this location, and if you don't like it, we can cancel the order. No harm, no foul.

Or if they don't know if they're going to pull up right now and they just want to reserve it, they can pay 10% of the cost. That would actually be another option. They can pay 10% of the cost, hold it, reserve it, lock in the price, and then they can come pick it up later. If they don't want it, they can always cancel, and then we'll issue the money back.

So that would be my process for solving this unique pain point and building an automated system and tool, website, lead generation funnel, tracking, like machine on steroids is what I want to build. And this is what I want completely expressed in long form, in a document that houses everything, so everybody between my team, my developers and my AI agents, everybody's on the same page.
