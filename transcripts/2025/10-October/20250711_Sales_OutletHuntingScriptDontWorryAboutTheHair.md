# "Don't Worry About the Hair" - Social Media Script for Nationwide Outlet Hunting Service

## Transcript

Playback for the mattress floor. I know what you thinking. What's with this guy's hair. Don't worry about that but you need to be worried about how to get the best deal on the top mattresses in the nation. That's what I specialize in.

Any mattress that you see in a Mattress Firm showroom, I can probably get in outlet to you for about 50% off. This is what I do. I'll hunt down and find some of the best mattresses in the game for friends and family, man. I can do this nationwide, all right?

All I need to know is where you're at, what your zip code, when you want to deliver it, and we go to work. What I can't do is tell you which mattress is best for you. That's a you thing, all right? If you need help figuring it out, narrow things down, I can assist. I can offer recommendations, I can offer you advice, things like that, but what I can't do is tell you there's one specific mattress that's best for you. That's a you thing.

I want you to take your time to figure it out, and when you do, just come to me. I'll figure it out. I'll figure out how to get you the best deal on that mattress that you love, all right? This is what I do, is what I love to do. I got plenty of time to do it. All right?

So get to work, go to a showroom, check out the mattresses, make sure you try it in the style that you sleep. Once you figure it out, send them my way.

## Key Points

- Preemptive hair acknowledgment: "I know what you thinking. What's with this guy's hair. Don't worry about that"—immediately addresses and dismisses the elephant in the room
- Value proposition: any mattress in Mattress Firm showroom, can probably get outlet for ~50% off
- Nationwide service: "I can do this nationwide"—not limited to local market
- Information needed: zip code, delivery timing, then "we go to work"
- Critical boundary: "What I can't do is tell you which mattress is best for you. That's a you thing"—won't prescribe, only optimize deal once customer knows what they want
- Will assist with recommendations/advice to narrow things down, but final decision is customer's
- Process: customer takes time to figure out what they love, then brings it to speaker who hunts down best deal
- Call to action: "Go to a showroom, check out the mattresses, make sure you try it in the style that you sleep. Once you figure it out, send them my way"
- Positioning: friends and family service, "this is what I do, is what I love to do. I got plenty of time to do it"
