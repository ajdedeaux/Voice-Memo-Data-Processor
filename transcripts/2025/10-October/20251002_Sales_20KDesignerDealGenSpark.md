# The $20K Designer Deal - How AI Translates Between Industries to Kill Objections Before They Happen

## Transcript

OK, here's a powerful story from my real life and mattress sales. So I've been working at Mattress Firm as a sleep expert for the last two years, I think. I started probably June. Yeah, like June 2023 up until this point. And over the course of that time, I've risen to the top salesperson in my district year over year, consistently outperforming the entire district since I hit the sales floor. Like, that's pretty dope. Coming from my, you know, background and where I was just at. 

But I have to give credit where credit is due. While I've been in sales and I've been in sales for a long time and I understand it, I also understand that I don't know everything, but I do understand I got a button that I can push to find out the answers to anything I have questions to. And I also understand that I can generate pieces of content to explain and express myself better than I could do with just verbal communication.

So here's an example. I work with Mattress Firm. We have access to like the top brands in the nation. Some really expensive mattresses from Tempur-Pedic, Stearns and Foster, Beautyrest Black, Purple—like some of these sleep systems can be $16,000, right? Or more. And so it's a big ticket sales going on in here.

So one day I had a customer come in and she explained—she's like, hey, I need to furnish my home and I need to get five beds. So I'm like, five beds. Okay, cool. This is a big sale. I'm like, one second. Let me grab my phone. I don't want to miss anything. So I immediately pull out my phone and go to ChatGPT, right? So I just hit record and as we're going through, she's explaining to me what she needs.

She's explained that she has a designer who is designing her dream home where she's—basically she's waited 30 years to finally purchase her dream home. And she has a designer that is getting custom furniture and beds, bed frames all in the rooms and all of this, right? So she's like, the designer sent me the specs and I need specific mattresses and heights and stuff. And so I'm like, perfect. Can you send that to me real quick? The spec sheet? So I have her just send that to my phone and I upload that, drop it into ChatGPT. And now I have an outline.

We need seven beds. Actually, it was seven beds. Excuse me. So in the bunk room, there's going to be one, two, three, four queen mattresses. In the two guest rooms, there were going to be two king mattresses. And then in the master suite, there was going to be another king. And that was going to be hers.

So the bunks, the bunk room needed a mattress that was going to be nice, but it couldn't be over like 10 inches. It needed to be a 10 inch mattress. So we have that spec. Then the other ones can't be over like 15 inches or something like that for the guest bedrooms. And then the last one needed to be at least 10 and no more than like 16 inches, right? So, bam, we have all the specs.

So I immediately go through the process and I'm like, okay, we knock out—I'm like, I know the perfect one for the 10 inch guest bedroom here. So we knock that out. We get four knocked off, checked off the list. Then we go to the guest bedrooms, knock those out. Then we get to her pain point. Now, she's like, I need X, Y, and Z because I have back pain, I have this, and I just want a bed that I'm going to love. And I'm like, perfect. She was so excited to get to the point where we're talking about her bed, her master suite.

So I take her to like Tempur-Pedic and I show her the mattress, but I said, first, I want to show you something for your back. And I showed her the adjustable base. Now, the reason why I wanted to show her the adjustable base and this specific one is because I've seen time and time again how adjustable bases can fail within a setup and how this specific adjustable base has been designed so well that it works in all bed frames, all designs, very clean. It's amazing. And I know that because I've worked with designers before. Designers only want—like they don't care about sleep or anything like that. That's not their lane. They only see design and aesthetics, clean lines, things like that, right? They don't want anything that's going to disrupt their vision and their artistic vision for this project, right?

So understanding that, I'm already ahead of the game. So I'm explaining to her why this adjustable base will be perfect to solve this one pain point that she has, her back. So I show her the base, explain how to use it, give her a demonstration. She loves it. She wants to get a king or a split king with the adjustable bases.

Now I have to explain to her like, this is why you need this base and why I'm suggesting this one over some other ones that won't work. The compatibility factor. This will be compatible with whatever your designer is putting together. And I know she probably wants it to be a specific look. And based on the specs here, this is going to be perfect within the designer specs. But she may not fully understand that. So what I'll do is I'll put together a package that she can understand and it'll have all the dimensions and sizing and all the information that she needs so she can do what she needs to do as far as building everything out, right?

So because I'm ahead of the game and I'm getting ahead of all the issues, she is completely—she just is like, this is perfect. Oh my gosh, thank you so much. This is exactly what I want. I feel like I can save money by working with you. If I was to have her do it, it's going to cost, I don't know, 30% of anything—I got to pay her for her time and yada, yada, yada. So I'm like, no problem. Like I work with designers all the time. And sometimes they don't fully understand. I'm like, but don't worry. I will put together something for her so she has something. It'll make it very easy for her to do everything that she needs to do and then it'll still make sure that you get everything that you need.

Understanding all of that, now I'm already like, okay, now we're at like a 20K deal. It's like a $20,000 setup overall. So I'm like, I don't want to lose this deal, but I know that the designer can kill the deal simply by saying that's not going to work within the setup that I have, that won't work.

Understanding this, I went to a tool. I went to GenSpark. So I love GenSpark. You can create just about anything you can imagine. So I did the same thing I'm doing right now. I had a conversation, I hit tap to transcribe, and I just did a messy brain dump, recounting everything that happened during the conversation and explaining that a designer needs a certain type of spec.

So I dropped a spec sheet in, I explained the mattresses and everything that we're doing. And then I got all the measurements and I pulled all the measurements for the mattress, the sizes, everything, right? And then built it into the specs sheet.

And then this is where imagination and understanding of the tools that are available, why it's important, right? So now, I understand that there's a language barrier, right? But this is a large language model. Large language models speak any language. Now, that doesn't mean just English to Spanish or Spanish to English or English to French, right? It means mattress firm sleep expert to interior designer. I need to translate mattress language and industry jargon to designer understanding, language and design and understanding, right?

So I put all the information that I know to be understood. And I said, I need you to translate this into a designer friendly spec and outline everything. But I also want you to take into account that designers don't like certain things. What are their pain points? What are the things that they hate? What problems—what are the things that she's going to say that will kill this deal? Tell me right now. And then let's reverse engineer a document that will answer all her questions, give her everything she needs, and make it to where all she can do is say yes.

So it did that brilliantly, right? It designed a specs sheet. I dropped in pictures of how it would look and the sizing and everything. Everything a designer would need. And then I put it together and then I turned it into a PDF and I sent it to the customer.

And then the customer, sure enough, was like, hey, the designer's going to call you. And guess what? That designer, when she called, she's like, I don't know why she went in there. I didn't tell her to go in there. I don't think this is going to work. Like, this is like, we already have the frames.

I'm like, don't worry, I understand everything. I've worked with designers before. I understand the things that you need. This is why I specifically selected and suggested this adjustable base. It's not going to mess up your vision or what you have in mind. I have a whole spec sheet. I have a whole PDF. I'm going to send this to you. It'll answer any questions. If you need any other measurements or anything else you need, just send it my way.

And I completely shut that down before she could kill the deal. I sent it to her and she called back and she's like, you know what? I think this will work. If I have any other questions, I'll give you a call, right? And that's it. Lock the deal in, 20K deal saved.

Where other people that wouldn't have got ahead of the problem, would have maybe suggested something that wouldn't work and wouldn't have been able to understand what the designer's problems and pain points would be, and then they'd be caught off guard in the conversation instead of being the one up front leading the conversation and addressing any issues ahead of time and killing everything up front, right?

So that's why I'm a top sales rep because I understand how to use different things. And I bring it all together to solve problems for my customers and for myself. So that's the story of the designer and how I can create content to help serve my clients.

And that's why businesses need to be not just giving their team AI tools. They need to be helping their team understand how to use these tools every day to serve their customers at 10X, 250X speed compared to the competitors. And once you're able to get your team to understand what's possible, they're able to come up with creative solutions quickly and serve the customers' true needs faster than anybody else in any of the other competitors.

So if you're not doing this with your team and augmenting your team with machines and your team collaboration isn't around the future, you're going to be left behind and you're going to lose to someone like me who's been behind for 10 years in federal prison and gets out and fully understands how to use these tools and becomes a top sales rep within, you know, a month of being on the sales floor.

That's the difference between doing things the way you're doing right now and supercharging your team to understand not only how to use the tools, but what's possible with these tools. And then allowing them, with their subject matter expertise, to use these tools and create new creative ways to build content that serves your customers and moves things forward because you don't need to have a design team or a programmer. Like, your one sales rep or your one person is now all of those things in one, and then they can understand how to communicate what they're doing to other departments that speak a different language.

So that is the power here. And if people fully understand what's possible, then that's when your team and your corporation and the whole company get 250X results, compounded over time. And that's where people get—that's where entire organizations get left behind. So that's where we're at right now. Hopefully this helps.
