# From the Stone Ages to the Top 5 - Why I'm Not Cutting My Hair Until They Can't Ignore Me

## Transcript

You seem like kind of before you probably thinking oh, look, it's the mattress guy about to talk about some mattresses again. Now I'm at the crib right now. We ain't on that. Let me tell you what I'll be doing behind the scenes and you can see right there in boxes, there's a backstory to it.

So, July 23rd, 2014, I was locked up in federal prison. I spent about 10 years, almost 10 years, got out April 19th, 2023, all right? This is right when ChatGPT was hitting the market. Luckily I got blessed, my uncle offered me an opportunity to come out to Florida and learn from him. He's a high level consultant, and he's been playing around and speaking about AI since I was in prison. He was sending me books and all kind of shit, right?

So, fast forward, ChatGPT is hitting the market. I spent the last 10 years in prison, right? No phone. I was basically in the Stone Ages. And over the last two years, every day, I've been diving into these tools, right? If you were—some people are just now getting on ChatGPT, but I've been in the trenches. Claude, ChatGPT, Google Gemini, Perplexity, Replit, like all these tools, like there's so much going on.

And I think there's a lot of people out there that don't fully understand what's possible, what they could be really doing with these tools and how to leverage them. I mean to tell you that if you take the time to really play around with this stuff and really understand what's going on, you could transform the position that you're in. We're living in a time where everything is shifted. When everything starts to shift like this, there's money to be made, right? So don't sit around and wait and get left behind.

Let me show you something, man. I think I had this book. It scared the shit out of me when I was in prison. Here it is. Yeah. Homo Deus by Yuval Harari, all right? There's a passage in this book where he talks about a useless class, right? And this scared the shit out of me. I'm reading this in prison, right? And he's talking about the advancements in tech, AI and how there is going to be a new class of people who get basically pushed aside because they don't have the skills to add value in the economy, all right?

So I'm in prison reading this, and I'm already like damn. I'm like I'm probably like five years to the gate, and I'm scared to death like, oh shit. I'm already tripping off how I'm gonna get a job. And I'm not definitely wasn't going back to some dope and doing none of that. So, I'm like, what do I gotta do? I just started reading. That's all books, all books, all books and notes and ideas and business shit. I was in there acting up. That's all I did. I was just reading, trying to get ahead. Because I was scared to death.

He talks about he called them the useless class. I already got a record, I already got a whole bunch of other shit homie, hanging over me, stigma, and I said, you know what? I definitely not gonna be useless, got me fucked up. So I was reading these books and I'm telling you, I've been out two years now. I've already made over 100K, fresh out of—look, look at this. You see my hair? There's a story for this too.

I told myself I wasn't gonna cut my hair, wasn't gonna do none of that shit. You know why? Because there's guys coming up behind me, probably think it can't be done. Shit can't be done. They got excuses. I was like, you know what? I'm going to make it happen, regardless, and I'm gonna do it with my hair. I'm not gonna change all that other shit. I'm just gonna be so valuable. I'm gonna figure out how to be so valuable that nobody can ignore it.

And since I've—you see the mattress shit—I've been a top performer since the day I hit the sales floor. Consistently. If anybody's in sales, you know, a lot of times you have people like sales rep, oh, they have a great month and then next month they crash and then they kind of level out and they just kind of hover right here. Oh no, no, no. I've been at the top, top five, every single month. And year over year, I am top performer rep in my district, right?

And it's not because I'm smarter than anybody or—it's I just I'm hungry and I'm excited and I'm curious, I wanna learn, and I wanna help people and this is just who I am. So I gotta—and then I got other driving factors. I can't fuck up, right? I gotta make this work.

So, I'm here to let you know that if you are struggling with AI or any of this shit, just hit me up. My uncle lights me up, Zoom calls. We playing around with this shit. And this is just my way of saying, hey, look, if you are struggling, you need some help, you need some guidance, you got any questions, just reach out, man, for real.

I'll show you some of the things that I built. I helped my brother, I plugged his website up, his website is automated, all the shit comes through, bing, bing, bing, bing, bing. I build logos and got a couple people's businesses going and yeah, I'm just I'm making good money at the mattress place and I'm able to play around with all these tools on my off time or downtime and yeah. I just want you to know, this is what I'm up to for real, behind the scenes and let me show you some of this shit that I got going on, all right?
