# Sleep Number i8 Deep Research Prompt - Systematic Competitive Intelligence to Fill Knowledge Gaps

## Transcript

OK, so I have a customer who has a quote for a Sleep Number and you know, I'm a sleep expert at Mattress Firm. And I'm trying to get all the way up to speed on every single thing about Sleep Number, everything. So we have a lot of cool policies here at Mattress Firm, and I need to make sure that what I'm saying is accurate. So what I need to do is a whole bunch of deep research in relation to Sleep Number.

Specifically, their mattresses, the models. In particular, the customer that I'm looking at is looking at the i8, the i8 model. I'll upload the quote that they have. There's some other pieces in there that I'm not familiar with, but this is the quote that they have.

So I need to know every single thing about their policies, returns. Can they return a mattress? What are the policies and stipulations behind the return if they don't like it? What about the exchange if they exchange or they want to swap it into something else because it's not working? Do they have to go up in price? What about if the mattress they want or the systems they want is less expensive? What's the policy there? Do they get the money back? The difference? How long is their sleep trial?

What about their financing? What are the terms on things like that? Is it 0%? And who do they use?

What about delivery? How is their delivery process? Who does it? Is it a third party? Is it them?

What about if something goes wrong with the mechanics, who takes care of that? Who's at fault? What's the warranty? What's the pricing on the warranty?

What are the drawbacks of having a Sleep Number? What are the benefits? I want to know everything because I may need to poke holes in this company, so I may need to—I need to know it at a deep level, like what is an advantage and what's a disadvantage for Sleep Number?

What's the process for the exchange or return? Do they come out there and pick it up? Can you only swap out the mattress and you get stuck with whatever's underneath? What needs to be underneath the mattress? Can you just buy the mattress by itself? Or does it need some sort of base or platform or something like that?

What's the warranty, like policies about that? Like, is there any specific clauses within the warranty that could jeopardize a warranty claim?

What are people saying as far as like problems that they've had with the Sleep Number? Reasons why they hate it? Reasons why they love it even. What about the i8 model in particular? What do people love and hate about that?

I need to know everything about Sleep Number, everything. When I say everything like, even things that I can't even think of, right? So I need it to be exhaustive, I need it to be—I need to be deep, all right?

So, let's go back and forth until we really refine this and get a real structured outlook for how we're going to go about this systematic deep research.

## Key Points
