# I Am a Weapon for My Customers - Building a Source of Truth in Mattress Sales

## Transcript

So what I kinda wanna do is express like my—the weapon that I am for a customer, right? I am a weapon for them. I'm the mediator. So here are some of the unfair advantages and unique value propositions that I offer as a sleep expert working at Mattress Firm, the largest mattress retailer in the nation.

Any mattress that you see, any product that you see on the Mattress Firm website, I have access to. I have access to all the inventory, not only on the website, but also in the warehouses at every single warehouse around the nation. All right? That doesn't just mean brand new products, but also outlet floor models, different things, creative ways that I can find to help save you money and get you into a mattress that you want for less.

Policies: 120 night sleep trial, unless a mattress gives you more, something like Nectar gives you 365 days as a trial instead. Like, you get to leverage that as well. So 120 night sleep trial, price match guarantee, which means that even after you purchase and it gets delivered, you have 120 nights to hunt down a better deal, unless it's like Craigslist or something like that. And I can match that and send you back money. Ten year warranty on most products, that's a manufacturer thing. Some of them have longer, some of them have less, but standard is usually about 10 year warranty, right?

And then if there's an issue or a warranty that needs to be filed, you're not sent through a pipeline. You can actually call me and I can give you advice on how to navigate the whole process of filing a warranty claim, all right? I can direct you to the website, I can point you in the right direction, I can answer questions, I can see where a claim's at in the process, if it's something that we handle ourselves. So I have complete oversight over that, right?

Your returns, exchanges, and like price match and all that, I am the one that directly can oversee that and initiate that stuff for you. So if you want to do an exchange, maybe the mattress is too firm or too soft for you, you want to swap it out for something else. You just reach out to me and you let me know what you like and what you'd rather have. And then I initiate the swap for you.

You can go into a Mattress Firm showroom, try a different model, try whatever you like. You can get my expert feedback and I'll give you advice on what to try based on what you've experienced right now, what's not working for you, and I'll give you more recommendations. And you can go in and actually try the mattresses for yourself and I can hunt down better deals and give you really insightful information. I can find a showroom where a specific mattress that I think you'd like is at and locate it and then have you go in and try it so you can actually test it before you buy it, right? And I have complete oversight over all of that.

I can reach out to the store, talk to a person in the store, I can put notes in your system, in your profile to let people know where you're at, what to expect, how to guide you properly, and how to point you in the right direction. And then I can finalize everything all simply by sending you a link to pay and I schedule the delivery date time frame. I can schedule your delivery date and we'll come out and we'll install everything for you. It's White Glove delivery. You don't lift a finger. You just point and click. We'll set everything up for you and we'll haul away your old mattress, your old box spring, all of that, piece for piece.

So if you're getting some new box springs and a mattress, we're going to come out and we're going to set up the new—we're going to haul away, we're going to remove the old box springs, the old mattress, and we'll install the new stuff, right?

Now, if there's a price adjustment or anything like that, you just reach out to me, I do my due diligence, make sure everything checks out, and then I initiate that refund and then send you an updated receipt. So you have all that right there, all right?

If you have any questions, I answer those questions. You have direct access to me. You can send me a text message through our corporate chat, I'm the one that answers that, right? And if I'm busy and you need an answer right away, it goes to a real person within my district, first within my team. And then if nobody answers it right away, it goes to our entire district. And then somebody is going to answer your question or you can call any Mattress Firm that can pull up your profile with your phone number and answer any question that you have because we're all connected. So those are all the different benefits and policies that you get working with us.

Let's see, what else? Just my—and then also, I work—this isn't just hypothetical or theoretical information and feedback that I'm giving you or recommendations. My recommendations and my feedback are all based off problems that I run into working with clients. Delivery issues and fixing problems, like all of this is experience that is directly related to ensuring that you get the best service overall. If there's a problem, like, I've probably ran into it before, and I know how to navigate it and I know how to fix it. And it's my job to fix it. It's my job to ensure that you're happy and you're satisfied with your purchase long term, right?

So I follow up like seven days in, I'm going to check on you. 30 days in, I'm gonna make sure everything is right after the break in period. 60 days in, I'm gonna make sure that you're still happy with it. In 90 days, I'm going to reach out again and let you know, hey, look, it's coming up on your 120 night sleep trial. I hope everything is right. But if not, this is a good time to maybe, you know, readjust, right? So, and then I'll handle all of that.

I work—I run—I have to fix problems. So someone who, the difference between me and somebody else is, I've made more mistakes and fixed them than other people, right? Like, experience comes from making mistakes and making corrections and getting ahead of problems and making people happy and all of that, right? So I've done that so many different ways and have to find so many different creative solutions to problems. And I'm learning every single day. And then I'm providing that information back in a way that helps my clients understand better how to make a better decision.

My whole thing is, I'm not here to sell you any specific mattress. I honestly, for me, it's a you thing. I can't tell you what's most comfortable or what firmness level you need. I can provide recommendations, but at the end of the day, you make the final judgment call. It's my job to give you all the information you need in clear, concise ways with information that you can gather to make a well-informed purchasing decision. And if that purchasing decision is with us or with me at Mattress Firm, I handle everything else, right?

Now, if it's not with Mattress Firm, then at least you have more information to go out and find the best solution for you. But if it is here, you have my promise that I will do everything I can to make sure that you are happy and satisfied.

Now, what I want to do with this page, all my social pages, is I want to go from doing this just one-on-one in store with somebody to being able to help more people at once. So I want to go, I want my goal is to transform myself from a one to one person to a one to many. And your feedback and answers and questions and things like that help me learn better to serve more people, a bigger audience, and reach more people.

So that's why I wanted to create this page and this profile and this social page where, like, this is my source of truth. This is where I answer questions. I create content to help you, help add value to the process of purchasing a mattress or finding, getting good sleep and all of that, right? And then also a source of truth where it holds me accountable for my recommendations, my service, this is where you can express your concerns or things and give me feedback. And I can't run from it.

So you can come and ask a question or tell me something that you don't like and then I can help fix it. You can call me out if I'm wrong. And if there's something that I missed, I'm completely okay with going and doing some research and finding out where I went wrong and correcting it, making sure I don't make that mistake again. So the next person doesn't run into any problems, you know?

So for me, it's all a learning experience. And I think we learn best together as a whole. And this is a place where we can all learn together and we can have a source of truth that we can all rely on. So I will never delete a comment, but I will never just go and—I don't believe that there's no such thing as—I don't believe in the whole a customer is always right. There's bad customers just like there's bad businesses, just like there's bad salespeople and there's bad customers too. So if you're a bad customer, I will call you out on that.

Like there's some people that just don't listen, have really unfair expectations that think that they should be able to get around policies and different things that are built to protect a business, right? So I'm always going to do what's right by my customers. I'm gonna do what's right by the company as a whole, and I'm going to do what's right for me and for my long-term trust with my audience and the customers that I work with.

And I want this to be a source of truth where everybody can benefit and you can come and get some free value and ask questions, you can learn, and then we can learn together and then I can add more value to other people who may be having similar questions or be running into the same experiences. And that's the goal of this. And then if you want to work with me, you have all these guarantees baked in and you can be a part of making, bringing a little more clarity and truth to a confusing industry.
