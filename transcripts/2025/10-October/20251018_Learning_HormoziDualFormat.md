# Hormozi's Dual-Format Learning Strategy: Why I'm Buying Both

## Transcript

OK, so there's this one specific part in Alex Hormozi's book. I think he does it in both books that I have—the audiobooks. When he first starts out, he's basically explaining what the book's all about, and he's giving you tips and tricks on how to absorb the information quickly.

One of the recommendations he gives in the audiobook—he's like, "Hey, while you're listening, this is what worked for me: if you listen in audio but you have the book in front of you and you're underlining and highlighting and reading along at the same time, you're going to absorb the information much faster and more thoroughly," right?

So pause. I am fighting three different versions of myself—three different pieces of my brain. The critic in me is like, man, I see what you're doing here. You're not going to get me to not only buy your audiobook but also a physical copy of the book, and then you frame it like it's helping me. I'm like, oh man, come on.

But the logical brain of mine is sitting there like, well damn, I never tried that before. He might be on to something. This guy is sharp. I do have a hard time retaining information, and that actually does sound like a good idea because I do understand how the brain works. If you have a whole bunch of different ways you're attaching to information, you're going to absorb it more quickly because you have more reference points, right? So I'm like, damn, that makes sense. I can't ignore my logical brain.

And then the salesman in me is like, this nigga is brilliant. This motherfucker knows his shit. Like damn. Not only does he have an audiobook, but he found a way to sell his physical copy—or vice versa—and sell two copies of the same thing. I said damn, I applaud that. And then to frame it in a way that actually adds value to the reader or the person listening? I'm like, damn, this guy is good. That's good.

I think I'm probably going to do it because the logical brain in me and my want to learn is super high. I want to absorb this information. I want to remember it. I want it to click. I want it to be second nature to me. That's why I bought the book—to absorb the information, not to just read it and say I read it. I want to apply what I'm learning.

Plus, I'm already looking at dude's background and the things that he does, and I don't care what anybody else says. I'm going to make my own judgment call on a person. When I look at Alex Hormozi and the work that he does and the way he educates and explains things, I stay absorbing value out of his content—the free value. His transparency, everything just makes sense. So I'm like, damn, I like that.

I'm really leveraging the information he puts out by plugging it into AI. I can use Alex Hormozi as a name to pull concepts and frameworks just by using AI because he has so much content out there. I can be like, "Give me this in Alex Hormozi style," or "Take Alex Hormozi's frameworks and help me apply this toward generating leads." I can use that. But I had to know who Alex Hormozi was. I had to know some of his books or his content to understand—okay, pull Alex Hormozi's content and reference this out of this book, and it gets me to the information that I want because AI has that information accessible.

So I'm really feeling this, man. I've already bought two of the audiobooks, but I'm also going to get the regular physical book because I'm a person that loves to underline and scribble and put notes and do all that. That's what really helps me absorb information. That keeps my brain sharp.

I miss that mental gymnasium, man, when I was in prison. I used to be in that mental gymnasium. First thing in the morning, late night, I'm in the quiet room trying to study. Got my books open. I got a whole bunch of notes. Yeah, that's how I absorb information. That keeps me sharp.

So thanks, Alex, man. I'm going to try that and I applaud you for the way that you presented that, man. I'm going to take that. That is strategic. I can't poke no holes in it. Nice work, man.

## Key Points

- Hormozi recommends listening to audiobook while simultaneously reading physical book and taking notes for faster, deeper retention
- "I'm fighting three different versions of myself"—the critic, the logical brain, and the salesman
- Critic: "You're not going to get me to buy both versions"
- Logical brain: Multiple input modalities create more reference points for memory
- Salesman: "This nigga is brilliant"—respecting the strategy of selling two formats while adding genuine value
- Learning goal is application and mastery, not completion: "I want it to be second nature"
- Using AI to leverage Hormozi's frameworks: "Give me this in Alex Hormozi style" or apply his concepts to lead generation
- Personal study style: underlining, scribbling notes—keeps the brain sharp
- Prison mental gymnasium: quiet room, books open, notes everywhere—formative study discipline
- Transparency and free value from Hormozi's content builds trust and respect
