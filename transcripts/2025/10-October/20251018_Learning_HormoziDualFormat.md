# Hormozi's Dual-Format Learning Strategy - The Brilliant Sales Move That Actually Works

## Transcript

OK, so there's this one specific part in Alex Hormozi's book. I think he does it in both—in the two books that I have, like I have the audiobooks. I think he does it in both. Correct me if I'm wrong. But when he first starts out, he's basically explaining what the book's all about, and he's giving you tips and tricks on how to absorb the information quickly. Now, one of the recommendations that he gives in the audiobook, he's like hey, while you're listening, and this is what worked for me—if you listen while you're going through it in audio, but you have the book in front of you and you're underlining and highlighting and doing all of that and you're reading along at the same time, you're going to absorb the information much faster and more thoroughly, right?

So pause. I am fighting three different versions of myself or three different pieces of my brain, right? The salesperson in me is like, man, I see what you doing here. You're not going to get me to not only buy your audiobook, but also a physical copy of the book. And then you frame it like it's helping me. I'm like, oh, man, come on, right? 

But the logical brain of mine is sitting there like, well, damn, I never tried that before. And he might be on to something and this guy is sharp and I do have a hard time retaining information and that actually does sound like a good idea because I do understand how the brain works. If you have a whole bunch of different ways where you're attaching to information, you're going to absorb it more quickly because you have more reference points, right? And so I'm like, damn, that makes sense. Like, I can't ignore my logical brain, right?

And then the salesman in me is like, this nigga is brilliant. This motherfucker knows his shit like, damn. Not only does he have an audiobook, but he found a way to sell his physical copy or vice versa, you know, and sell two copies of the same thing. I said, damn, I applaud that. And then to frame it in a way that actually adds value to the reader, right? Or the person listening. I'm like, damn, this guy is good. Like, that's good.

And I think I'm probably going to do it because the logical brain in me and my want to learn is super, super high. Like, I want to absorb this information. I want to remember it. I want it to click. I want it to be like second nature to me. That's why I bought the book, right? To absorb the information, not to just read it and say I read it. I want to apply when I'm learning.

And then plus, I'm already looking at dude's background and the things that he does and I don't care what anybody else says. Like, I'm going to make my own judgment call on a person and when I look at Alex Hormozi and the work that he does and the way he educates and explains things, I'm like, I stay absorbing value out of his content, the free value. And his transparency, like just everything just makes sense. So I'm like, damn, like I like that, right?

So this dude—I'm really leveraging the information that he uses by plugging it into AI. Like I can use Alex Hormozi as a name to pull concepts and frameworks and things from just by using AI because he has so much content out there. I can use like, okay, give me a, you know, write this in an Alex Hormozi style or take Alex Hormozi's frameworks and help me apply this toward generating leads. I can use that, right? But I had to know who Alex Hormozi was. I had to know some of his books or his content to understand like, okay, pull Alex Hormozi's content and then reference this out of this book and it gets me to the information that I want because AI has that information accessible. So I'm like, I'm really feeling this, man.

I'm probably going to dive in and I've already bought two of the audiobooks, but I'm going to also get the regular physical book because I'm a person that loves to underline and scribble and put notes and do all that. Like, that's what really helps me absorb information that keeps my brain sharp. I miss that mental gymnasium, man, I used to be in when I was in prison. I used to be in that mental gymnasium, man. First thing in the morning, late night, I'm in the quiet room, trying to study. Got my books open. I got a whole bunch of notes. And yeah, that's how I absorb information that keeps me sharp.

So thanks, Alex, man. I'm going to try that and I applaud you for the way that you presented that, man. I'm going to take that. That is strategic, man. And I can't poke no holes in it, man. I can't poke no holes in it. Nice work, man.

## Key Points

- Alex Hormozi recommends using both audiobook and physical book simultaneously—listening while reading, underlining, and highlighting—to absorb information faster and more thoroughly
- The speaker experiences an internal three-way debate: the critic sees the sales tactic, the logical brain recognizes the learning science, and the salesman admires the strategic brilliance
- "This nigga is brilliant. This motherfucker knows his shit"—appreciation for Hormozi finding a way to sell two formats while genuinely adding value to the customer
- Multiple attachment points to information create more reference points in the brain, leading to faster and deeper absorption
- The speaker's learning goal is application, not completion: "I want to absorb this information. I want to remember it. I want it to click. I want it to be like second nature to me"
- Leveraging AI by using "Alex Hormozi" as a prompt element to pull his frameworks, writing styles, and concepts for practical application like lead generation
- Had to study Hormozi's content first to effectively use his name and frameworks as AI reference points—"I had to know who Alex Hormozi was" to make AI queries work
- The speaker connects current learning methods to "that mental gymnasium" from prison—early mornings, late nights in the quiet room, books open, notes everywhere
- Physical note-taking, underlining, and scribbling keeps the brain sharp and aids information retention
- The sales tactic is unassailable because it's framed as genuine value: "I can't poke no holes in it, man"
- Hormozi's transparency and free content builds trust and credibility, making paid products an easier purchase decision
- The speaker values making independent judgments about people based on their work and educational approach rather than others' opinions
