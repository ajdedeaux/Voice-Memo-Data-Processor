# The Difference Between Working with a Salesperson and Working with an Expert

## Transcript

Let's talk about something. The difference between working with a salesperson and working with an expert. 

Example: a salesperson asks "What do you wanna buy? What do you like?" They ask surface level questions. Where an expert is gonna ask questions like "How do you...?" 

We're talking about mattresses right now, right? So let's start with a regular salesperson, maybe somebody who sells furniture, mattresses, and all kinds of other stuff, right? But they're not an expert in anything. They just sell stuff. Whatever's there, they sell, right? Compared to working with an expert.

So as an example, if somebody goes into, let's say, Ashley Furniture or Rooms To Go or something like that, a furniture store, right? And then they go talk to somebody about buying a mattress. That person is probably going to be like, "Oh, well, yeah, this mattress has..." and then they're going to pull out their little tag that's on the mattress on the foot of the mattress and they're going to flip it over and they're like, "These coils are like, they have their different..." They don't really know what the hell they're talking about, right? They're gonna ask you like, "Oh, what kind of mattress do you want? Or what are you going to buy?" They don't have good questions.

Whereas when someone comes and works with me, I'm going to ask like one of the first things I'm going to be like, "Okay, so who are we shopping for, right?" Because I need to know who's the mattress for? What room are we shopping for? Because that determines a lot, right? 

Because if they say, "Oh, we're buying two mattresses." All right, had a customer today. "We're buying two mattresses." "Oh, okay. I'm guessing, correct me if I'm wrong, but two mattresses, maybe one for the master bedroom and one for the guest bedroom?" "Yeah, exactly." "Okay, cool."

And so for the guest bedroom, I kind of like to think of a guest bedroom as like, I don't like to overthink about a guest bedroom. I just follow the recipe that's been working for years and just kind of adopt what hotels use, right? And they're like, "Yeah, that sounds about right." 

Like, "Okay, so my methodology for a guest bedroom is, you want to have something that is going to be nice enough to where they don't hate you in the morning at breakfast, right? Nice enough to where they don't want to stay somewhere else instead of at your house on your terrible guest bed, right? But not so nice that they wanna move in." I usually get a laugh out of that and they usually agree.

Like, "Okay perfect. Well, this is what hotels usually do and have been doing for years. They get usually more of like a medium to medium firm mattress, or firm mattress, and then they add a comfort topper on top of the firm mattress. And they usually go with something that is traditional, like a traditional innerspring pocketed coil and make sure it has good edge support because you want it to hold up over time and you just want it to complement most styles of sleep."

Now most people are side sleepers. So if somebody is a side sleeper, you wanna make sure that their shoulder and their hips are relieved of pressure, pressure points that build up, because your shoulder and your hip are the things you're laying on, right? But you also want to make sure the spine stays aligned throughout the night. So you want to give them the most important things without spending a whole bunch of extra money on like advanced cooling features and all this extra stuff that costs extra money, right?

So I usually take them to a couple of my top favorites that I usually call like the "old faithful." Like these are old faithful. They're just great mattresses. Nothing super special, but always top sellers. They don't really change too much. And they just consistently perform and are top sellers. And I love them. I can count on them. They're just old faithful, right?

And then I'm like, "Okay, now after we finish that, let's talk about you. Let's save the best for last. So your primary room, your master bedroom is going to be the one that's for you, that you're sleeping in every night. This is where you recharge and you rebuild, right? You get ready to... you gotta recharge and heal and all that, and be ready for all the cool stuff that you're supposed to do the next day."

So, I'm like, "This is where we're going to really ask a lot of questions. How do you sleep? Do you sleep on your side, stomach, back? Where do you notice pain at? Like, what's keeping you up at night? Like outside of your mind racing like 1000 miles per minute..."

And if they tell me that they have pain, I'm gonna ask where and then I'm going to correlate that with like if they're a side sleeper and they have shoulder or hip pain, I'm gonna ask like, "Okay, what is your mattress like right now? Is it like a firm, medium, soft?" And then I'm gonna take them to mattresses and then show them the difference. And so I can get an idea of what they deem to be comfortable.

And then after they tell me they like, I'll show them usually like three styles that way they could tell me what their body is feeling and then I get a better idea, a better understanding of what's comfort to them because I can't tell them what's comfortable, right?

And then after we both have a clear understanding, we're aligned and I can articulate back to them that I understand what comfort is to them and I can show them more of what that looks like in different price ranges and things that have the same similar features and styles and makeups. And then I ensure that they only pay for the things that are most important and they don't pay for the extra stuff so I can save them money.

And then after we figure out which ones they like, then I go and I try to find ways to creatively find solutions to the pricing, right? Then I go to find ways to make the whole package more valuable for them by finding ways to reduce costs, find hidden little options where they can save money or add value. I show them a base. I show them pillows and sheets and everything to give them the whole experience right and add value to the whole package.

Now somebody who is just a salesperson doesn't do all that. They don't even think like that. They haven't solved enough problems to know what questions to ask. And they're just looking for the person to tell them like, "Oh, I want to buy this." And they're like, "Okay, I'm a cookie cutter, I'm an order taker. I will take this order and I will lock it in and we'll sell and I'll sell you this. What day do you want to buy it?" Right?

I'm going to ask, once we decide which mattress and we got the price and everything together, I'm going to ask them about their delivery. "Okay, now as for your delivery, is there anything that our delivery team needs to know in regard to your delivery? Anything special? Because if our delivery team can find a way to get lost or find a way not to find your address, they're going to find a way to get lost, right? So is there anything specific I might need to tell them as far as directions in order to find your home?"

"Okay, now let's talk about your home. Now for your home, do you have like a staircase that maybe has like, you go up the stairs then you turn and then there's a landing space and it's tight? And what about the roof? Does it slant down? Is it going to be really tight? I know you're getting a king size mattress. I don't want there to be any issues with that. And I don't want things like... Is there, am I going to need to bring some extra people out there? We're going to need some more hands on deck? Okay. All right, cool. We are all on deck. Do I need to put some extra notes into the system?"

"Okay, now who's gonna be picking up the phone on the day of delivery? Because this number here at the top is gonna be the number they call. So I don't want them to be calling you, sir, when you're gonna be at work that day. I want them to call the missus. Okay ma'am, oh you're gonna be the one there for the delivery on this date. Okay, let's switch this number out to ensure that the delivery team is calling the right number on the day that they bring the whole setup right." That's eliminating issues up front.

"Okay perfect, now what is the mattress going to sit on?" Like questions before that, I'm asking early on like, "What is your mattress going to sit on? Is it like a bed frame with a headboard and footboard and side rails? Or is it like a raised platform? Or is it nothing at all? Or is it like a bed frame?"

"Now, okay, if it's a bed frame, does it have slats like those things that look like little railroad tracks, like those wooden slats? Okay, now, if it has slats, okay, now, how close together are those slats? Are they really close together, or are they kind of spread out far apart? Okay all right. Oh, if it doesn't have slats, does it have like a crossbeam type of thing in there? Okay all right cool. Well, that's gonna need a box spring."

"Okay, those slats, where do they sit in the bed frame? Are they kind of like right on top or are they down inside of the bed frame? Okay, well, let's pull it up. Do you have a picture? Do you know what model you're gonna get? Let's pull it up together on Google and I'll look at it and then I'll look at all the specs on there and this will help us understand if we need to buy a box spring. And if we get a box spring, what size box spring? Is it going to be a five inch or a nine inch traditional box spring? Or is it a really low gap and all we need to do is get a bunky board or ultra low profile box spring? Okay perfect."

Right? I'm gonna ask all of those questions when I'm working with a client because I know what it's like to buy a mattress and all the issues that can come up and I'm going to get ahead of all of them and I'm going to guide the conversation. I'm going to ask the right questions so I can gather more information to get a better understanding of what's important to them and then open up options based on what they find most important and their criteria.

So, and then help educate them along the process and answer any questions that they may have. And then by asking better questions, they have more questions and we answer those and it's a long drawn out process, but they're feeling really confident about this. They know this is what they need and why they need it and then what they don't need. And then they're able to articulate back to me, "Oh, I like this based on this and because you told me that this may cause a problem, I think that I agree with you there. So for that reason, I don't want to go with this one. We definitely want to be right here at this one. This is the one," right? Perfect.

"Now, things can happen, right? I want you to wake up in the mattress to make sure that this is the mattress for you. So we're going to get as close as we can now, but when you wake up in the morning, we want to make sure that you still love it. That's why you have 120 nights to wake up in the mattress and make sure that through the break in period, you feel like it's the right mattress for you."

"And throughout that process, I'm gonna be bothering you. I'm gonna be calling seven days in. 'Hey, how you doing?' 30 days in, 'Hey, the mattress is kind of broken in now. How are you feeling about it?' Oh, 60 days in, 'You still loving it?' Okay cool. 90 days in, 'Hey, we're getting closer to 120 day sleep trial. Is this the one you wanna be in for the next 10 years?'"

"If not, let's go back to the drawing board and trust me, you will understand better. The second time around what you need because you will be more educated and then on the second go-round, you will fully understand like, 'You know what? I noticed that I'm feeling a little bit of pain in my shoulder and I think I need something with a little more pressure relief.' You'll be able to articulate that because you now have the bag of words, you have the information, you have the lingo down, and you can articulate what you need better and then you'll make a better decision that'll be spot on the second time around."

"And I'm just here to facilitate the entire process and if there's a headache, it's on me. That's my job. I solve it. Headaches are mine. You don't... you leave them alone. You just tell me what the problem is and give me all the information I need and I go out and solve the problem, right? And that's how I do business and that's the difference between working with an expert and working with a salesperson."
