# The Race to Disruption - The Four-Layer Pattern That Repeats Through Every Content Revolution

## Transcript

After reading through all of this stuff, I've been tasked with doing deep research on one of the seven AI capabilities and I chose content creation. And my task was to go through history and find the patterns that emerged. So I've been deep diving and each deep dive has pretty much set me back deeper down through another deep dive, and I learned a lot. All through deep research, running through, running different prompts, trying different LLMs, seeing what they all had, trying to converge them all to find the synthesis of information, like, what held true throughout them all. There was so much work. It was intensive, right? And you would think like, oh, hey, AI speeds everything up. Yeah, it speeds it up, but I mean, it's still very intensive, right?

So I'm diving through all of this and what started to come through is a pattern, right? That's starting to emerge. And that pattern is the cycle at which content creation shifts everything, right? So here, let me—and hopefully it all makes sense, but basically, we're pretty much in a race for disruption. A race to disruption, right? What we're trying to do, everybody in business, I guess. There's—I feel like, let me explain. So there's four layers to this, four personas, you could say, right?

You have, at the lowest level, the consumer. This is the person that just consumes whatever the platform—they're just a consumer, right? They're just absorbing this. One of the things that they have to, or that's a byproduct of the consumer, is a skill. A consumer usually learns some skill, right? Even if it's unintentionally. Quick example, like, Gutenberg created the—influenced the printing press. And the mass dispersion of pamphlets and reading material required a new skill to be developed by the consumer, and that was reading. They had to learn how to read in order to develop the deeper skill, which they probably saw within the people at the top, which was their ability to challenge and bring about different perspectives after having read something that they didn't believe, right? So it gave them a voice. And in order to be part of that conversation, I guess they'd have to learn how to read as, like, at least bare minimum. They have to learn how to read.

Now, most people didn't know how to read at that point, but it exploded the amount of people that learned how to read. And in a short amount of time, right? So mass adoption, new skill unlocked, and a new technology that made it all possible, a new medium for which the content could be distributed.

Now, from the consumer, the next step up is the creator. So who's creating this new piece of information or this new piece of content? So the creator. So for this example, it would be—maybe not Gutenberg, but it was Luther, who created all of this, the pamphlets. And then you had authors and things like that, right? So now you have the creators, right?

But the creators are actually forced to use the medium, which is the technology, to disperse their creation. And this technology was the printing press. So the printing press really becomes the medium, and the people who crave the power want to own and control the medium for the distribution of the content because the masses want the content, the creators want the medium in which to distribute their creation to reach more people. And the people that want to gatekeep, they want to control the medium to which all of it is centralized.

And so as soon as this new technology erupts, you have things that must happen. For the people that don't know what's going on, they just pretty much are just going to be left by the wayside. They pretty much just, they're at the mercy of whatever happens. They have no control over anything. They're just going to consume whatever. When it happens, it happens and they're just a byproduct. But they're really the reason—they are the ones that end up just making everybody else money.

Now, the creators are the ones who see the technology and they have the ideas. These are the idea guys that understand like, oh, my gosh, I have this idea that needs to get out. And they have this new medium. They are the ones that are running to learn how to master this new medium in which to distribute this content or this information, whatever the case may be. They're learning, they're striving and trying their best to learn to master the new medium because this is going to be the next wave.

And for the people who created it, they're not always the ones who end up being the gatekeepers, but there are people who become the gatekeepers. So in this case, it became the newspaper, the big newspaper companies and publishing companies, right? Big publishing companies, they became the gatekeepers. And in order to get your content out, you got to go through them, right? Because through them, the masses absorb this content and they understand that, right?

Once you have—so that's kind of how that works, right? And then it usually goes, it seems that the people who—after the gatekeepers finally figure out how to lock in and keep people out or force—they pretty much have a monopoly on things. And you don't really get to dictate. You don't get to choose. You're pretty much at their mercy. So if they say you got to pay for ads, you got to pay to get your stuff distributed through us, that's what you got to do because you need who they have. They have the distribution. They are the platform through which the consumer consumes. So they are stuck. And they usually are really frustrated. It's the fight against the man that has the platform, the medium. Whoever created that, angry, right?

But they've had to learn to understand and leverage the platform and it's just part of business. You have to learn the new tools, right? Where everybody's at. So they learn it and they learn it. And then through frustration, usually an innovation and understanding history and new technology emerges. And it becomes a race to the disruption, the race to disruption.

So there will be another new technology that comes around that completely disrupts the gatekeepers. And for this example, we will use the example of the radio or the airwaves. They came and they were now the disruptor, adding in a new layer of information and content absorption for the consumer. Now they don't just have to read and understand, they can now hear and understand, and they have more context. They can do it more quickly. And now this mass adoption leads to just about everybody having a radio, right? Standard operating procedure. You got a radio in your home.

And then the gatekeepers come. Now you have the broadcast companies, the radio stations, all of that, right? And the disruption to that was TV. Now, the consumer has more ways to absorb information and learn, and they want more of it, right?

And the consumer is the one thing you can't control. They're gonna go wherever they find the most value and they're the ones who determine value. Now, the creators are trying to leverage these things to provide value through these mediums when they're content creators and the gatekeepers are trying to control the medium through which all the content is produced and distributed to the masses because that is how you control ideas and how you sway economies and people and nations through control of the masses. And this is how it just continues to evolve over time.

From there, it turned into the algorithm. Google, all this information now, we have all this—we have all this information. It needs to be structured, it needs to be—how quickly can we get to this information now that there's so much of it? Google learned how to do that, right? And they disrupted a lot. And then came YouTube, basically taking away all the power of the big media companies who had had it for ages. Right now, it is the YouTube, the streaming, the internet, right?

And now we have this AI revolution, an intelligence revolution, and it's basically accumulation of everything that was before us combined into one at the tip of your fingers. If you understand how to press the button, if you understand how to use the skill. But at the very best right now, at this point in time, we already see that we're pretty much just going to be hopefully the best creators within this space, right? Because the gatekeepers have already started to emerge. The gatekeepers—ChatGPT, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, things like that, right? So these are looking like the new gatekeepers, and there's more to be said.

But now it's a matter of, okay, how—if you're you, if you don't have, if you're not going to be the gatekeeper here, you're not going to be the one in control of the actual medium, your business is going to be built on these new mediums. These are how the people are going to want to consume everything. How are you racing to try to be the next disruptor, if that's what you want to be? Or the best creator on this platform to reach your audience because they are going to have control over the way we consume everything.

So that is what I've learned in the history of what I've learned over the last, I don't know, five days of deep research, leveraging AI, and it all boils into that seven AI capabilities. There's seven AI capabilities, and this is just one of the seven. One of the seven. And it's very important that you understand how to leverage each individually, but how to understand all the capabilities that this technology has at its disposal. And then understanding as a business owner how to supercharge your employees, your workforce to serve your clientele at the highest level, because that will determine success moving forward.

## Key Points

- Tasked with deep research on content creation (one of seven AI capabilities)—running different prompts across multiple LLMs to find synthesis of what held true across all of them, intensive five-day research process
- Discovered repeating four-layer pattern throughout content history: Consumer → Creator → Medium → Gatekeeper
- **Consumer layer:** Byproduct is skill acquisition (Gutenberg's printing press required masses to learn reading to participate in conversation—mass adoption, new skill unlocked)
- **Creator layer:** The idea people who see new technology and race to master the new medium to distribute their content—"running to learn how to master this new medium because this is going to be the next wave"
- **Medium layer:** The technology through which content is distributed—printing press, radio, TV, internet, algorithms, now AI—whoever controls the medium controls the distribution
- **Gatekeeper layer:** Big publishing companies, broadcast companies, Google, YouTube—"the people who want to gatekeep, they want to control the medium to which all of it is centralized"
- Creators stuck at gatekeeper's mercy: "If they say you got to pay for ads, you got to pay to get your stuff distributed through us, that's what you got to do because they have the distribution"
- "Through frustration, usually an innovation and understanding history and new technology emerges. And it becomes a race to the disruption, the race to disruption"
- Historical disruption cycle: Printing press → Radio (hearing + context) → TV (visual + audio) → Google algorithm (structured search) → YouTube (creator distribution) → AI (intelligence accumulation)
- AI revolution = "accumulation of everything that was before us combined into one at the tip of your fingers. If you understand how to press the button, if you understand how to use the skill"
- New gatekeepers already emerging: ChatGPT, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini—"we're pretty much just going to be hopefully the best creators within this space"
- Critical business question: "How are you racing to try to be the next disruptor, if that's what you want to be? Or the best creator on this platform to reach your audience?"
- This is one of seven AI capabilities—important to understand each individually but also how to leverage all capabilities to supercharge workforce
