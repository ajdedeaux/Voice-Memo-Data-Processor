# 30 Days Out - Walking to Work, No Whip, No Handouts, Just Patience and Purpose

## Transcript

All right it's going to be my first entry. Tomorrow marks my 30 days since release. I was released on April 19th. Come pretty far in 30 days. I think it's important that you take a second to reflect on all your accomplishments and the things that you can pat yourself on the back for because sometimes you get lost in, lost in all the craziness and with everything's going on in the world. It's moving fast out here. Hella fast. They don't prepare you for this shit, not for real. It's probably why I still smoke these. Got to cut these out my life, but give myself grace too.

So, well, recapping these last 30 days. Morning. Recapping these last 30 days. I have snatched up all my identification. Social security card, I had that in the joint, had that sent in, that was easy. Birth certificate was hard. It's a long process. You got to pay for it. Moms would and grab that for me, had that sent like next day or something so I had that right away.

Took both of those forms, the ID down to the DMV, got my, got my driver—not my driver—that's my ID. I got to take the written portion of the driver's test to get my learner's. It's going to cost me 70 bucks. All right, bet. It's going to be the next step for real. I ain't really tripping on it cuz I don't have no whip, don't plan on buying no whip right now. I'm thugging it. I'mma walk, jump on this bus.

But I got a plan so none of this shit matter. I mean keep a nice pair of walking shoes. New Balance or something, pay 50 bucks for them. Grab you some work clothes. Thug it, man. It's important. That part is important. I feel where you got to, you got to go through the hard shit. You know what I mean? Don't try to take the easy way out. Don't jump on a Uber. That shit is expensive. I go buy you a whip now you got more payments. Now you putting yourself in a position where you going to maybe jeopardize something that's more important. I can't afford that shit. I can afford to walk. Keeps me healthy. I smoke these cigarettes, fuck. I got to do something to pay for that shit. Got to pay for this shit. Don't shit come easy.

I got a bunch of great people in my circle though. I can't even lie. Love y'all 100. Love y'all. You know what I mean? But I don't need no handouts. I don't want no handouts. I don't ask for no handouts. They be blessing me and then I turn around and bless who I can. Even when I'm doing bad, I didn't toss a [person] $100 or something cuz I know he hurting and I ain't really got it but I know I just got blessed and it turned back around and come bless me back.

I'm at the barber shop with my folks and you know what I mean, turned around and dude dropped me off some shirts as a just a—here, nice to meet you. You know what I mean? I heard you was good people. You going to keep you around good people. Here's some shirts. I know you got a job, you going to need these. We going to keep you around good people. I'm going to take care of your haircut, your lineup and [cut] is $35 off the dribble. Now yeah, all that $15 haircut [stuff]. I don't know what y'all hoping on. [Got] my wig hit. That [cut] cost me, you know what I'm saying, $250. You know what I'm saying, but that's an investment cuz I want to look good. I want to look how I feel. So you know, maintaining these [locs] after is going to be light work. Cool.

Plus I want to be able to show guys that you can go get a job and still look and have your [style] the way you want it cuz I feel like that's important too. But you got to have the other [stuff] and all the other groundwork laid first. I go out here expecting [stuff].

Got these [people] in the halfway house sitting there smoking hella deuce and [stuff]. Like you [folks] is bums. [Folks], y'all [ain't] even getting up off your ass to do nothing. Y'all sitting there hoping these [people] give you a job. Y'all don't even know how to articulate what you do. Y'all over here just complaining, man.

First day I went out, nah, I went out and try to go do something I know I could do. I know call center hire. I know telemarketing call center hire because they got a fast turnover rate. They always need somebody that can pitch a product and sit in a chair and pitch, pitch customers and piss people off. All right, bet. I know you need me. I need you. All right, cool. This a symbiotic relationship for right now until I get up, till I get to the next level. Because when I get to the next level, I ain't never gonna sacrifice doing some incongruent [stuff] like pissing people off, irritating people, going his backward ass way of acquiring customers. That ain't how you acquire customers. That ain't how you build relationships and build lasting business with people.

Now that's some scam [stuff]. I ain't on that but I'm, I'mma play the game right now. I got to. What I'm saying, got to play the game. Marc keep telling me man, take this [stuff] down to the basic principles of life. Basic principles of life: eat, don't get eaten. That's simple. I got to eat right now. I can't get eaten. I can't sit around and let my mind get eaten up in this halfway house dealing with all the [BS] that's going on in there. Can't afford that. I got to be out that [stuff].

But I also got to protect this good [stuff] that I been building and I got to get out of there fast. So my next step is to acquire this sales position at this Mattress Firm that fat boy put me out. Good looking fat boy. Good looking man. You know what I'm saying? So I'm acquire that. That's the next goal. So I'm building a resume that's going to articulate my strengths to acquire this position cuz I need that.

And one of my, one of the things I wrote down back when I was in the joint a long time ago, I wrote things that I was going to spend, I was going to spend on. One of those things was a nice bed. I spent too long on a bad bed. That's not even—it wasn't even a bed. It was a little—nah I ain't going to do that. My body deserve to recharge. I need to recharge this thing so I can give y'all all of this. You know what I'm saying? All of this.

So cool. All of a sudden a Mattress Firm job may, you know, a lane may be paved for that. Oh yeah, manifest that. Do that. But you got to envision all this. You got to see all this before it happens. Because that way when things start to happen and line up for you it's just like, oh there it is. Boom. And you smack off. Boom. And you go and you go attack because you already been waiting and waiting for this door and this opportunity to open up. You just waiting on it.

Then you got to have patience because you can't just jump on everything that look good. Nah, hell no. Pass something up. Pass up a lot of that. Smack off when you see that door crack and you know it's that door that you've been waiting on. Oh that's perfect. Oh there it go. Smack off and go grab that. Got to get that. Got to get that.

Yeah, I'm walking to work about to jump on this bus. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I feel good doing it.

So yeah, 30 days. And I've grown a lot. And I got a lot to work on but that's part of it. That's—I love that part too. And got a purpose. I got people I'm trying to make proud out here. You hear me? You hear me? All right, G on man. Got to catch this bus.

## Key Points

- **First journal entry**: tomorrow marks 30 days since release (released April 19, 2023)—May 18, 2023 at 7:35 AM
- **Reflection importance**: "Sometimes you get lost in all the craziness... it's moving fast out here. Hella fast. They don't prepare you for this shit, not for real"
- **ID acquisition**: social security card (had in prison, easy), birth certificate (hard, long process, had to pay, mom got it sent next day)
- **DMV**: got state ID, still needs to take written test for learner's permit ($70)—not tripping because no car, no plans to buy one
- **Walking/bus strategy**: "I'm thugging it. I'mma walk, jump on this bus. But I got a plan so none of this shit matter"—New Balance walking shoes ($50), work clothes
- **No shortcuts philosophy**: "You got to go through the hard shit... don't try to take the easy way out. Don't jump on a Uber. That shit is expensive. I go buy you a whip now you got more payments... I can't afford that shit. I can afford to walk. Keeps me healthy"
- **No handouts mindset**: "I don't need no handouts. I don't want no handouts. I don't ask for no handouts"—but when blessed, turns around and blesses others even when doing bad
- **Barber shop blessing**: dude dropped off shirts as welcome gift, heard he was good people, wants to keep him around good people—haircut/lineup $35 off the dribble
- **$250 locs investment**: "That's an investment cuz I want to look good. I want to look how I feel"—wants to show guys you can get a job and still have your style, but groundwork has to be laid first
- **Halfway house frustration**: people sitting around smoking, not getting up to do anything, hoping for jobs, can't articulate what they do, just complaining
- **First day strategy**: went straight for call center/telemarketing—"I know call center hire... they got a fast turnover rate, they always need somebody that can pitch a product"
- **Symbiotic relationship mindset**: "I know you need me. I need you... for right now until I get to the next level"—knows it's not congruent long-term (pissing people off, irritating people, backward way of acquiring customers), but playing the game right now
- **Marc's wisdom**: "Take this shit down to the basic principles of life. Basic principles of life: eat, don't get eaten. That's simple. I got to eat right now. I can't get eaten"
- **Halfway house urgency**: "I can't sit around and let my mind get eaten up in this halfway house... I got to be out that shit. But I also got to protect this good shit that I been building"
- **Mattress Firm manifestation**: next step is to acquire sales position at Mattress Firm (fat boy put him out)—building resume to articulate strengths
- **Prison planning**: wrote down things he was going to spend on while in prison—one was a nice bed—"I spent too long on a bad bed... my body deserve to recharge"
- **Manifestation philosophy**: "You got to envision all this. You got to see all this before it happens. Because that way when things start to happen and line up for you it's just like, oh there it is. Boom"
- **Patience and selectivity**: "You got to have patience because you can't just jump on everything that look good. Nah, hell no. Pass something up. Pass up a lot of that. Smack off when you see that door crack and you know it's that door that you've been waiting on"
- **Walking to work feeling**: "Yeah, I'm walking to work about to jump on this bus... and I feel good doing it"
- **30 days reflection**: "I've grown a lot. And I got a lot to work on but that's part of it. That's—I love that part too. And got a purpose. I got people I'm trying to make proud out here"
