# From Stone Age to 10 Years Ahead - The ChatGPT Origin Story Nobody Sees Coming

## Transcript

OK, let's recount some of the story with my uncle and ChatGPT, what actually happened when I got out and how did I first encounter ChatGPT?

So while I was locked up and I was getting towards the end of my bid, I got denied the ability to go back home. I was gonna get out early on early release and they—I needed a place to go and my mom, she basically failed the test for me. Like, they came out to inspect the house and the probation officer asked her some tough questions. One of them something along the lines of, well, if he doesn't—if he needs to get into a check in and he needs to get there right away, how is he gonna get there? And she said, I don't know. Like, he could take the bus or something, right?

So they didn't want to hear that. They really want you to have somebody that is going to pretty much move on command and do all of that, right? So they were like, nah, I think it's better that he just continues to stay in jail and they denied me from going to in-home—like it was home confinement where I would have been on an ankle monitor. And this is kind of like the end of everything with COVID. So there was a bill that was out and it was like basically the First Step Act and it was saying, if, you know, you're close to the door, you're about to go home, and you have a place that you can go, you can finish the rest of your time at home instead of in the cell or in prison where, you know, a lot of issues were coming up when it comes to COVID and the health risk and stuff like that.

So I had that opportunity, but it got denied. But it was a blessing in disguise. So when I got denied, it crushed me. I remember hearing that, finding out, I was talking to my case manager and they told me, yeah, they denied this. And I'm watching guys come in and go home like that, just got in and they're getting like, they're able to do three years on home confinement. And I'm sitting there like, man, I've been doing all this time. Like, there's no reason my mom shouldn't be able to—I shouldn't be able to go to my mom's like a good home. There's like stability, everything, right?

But I think it was more God just aligning me and putting me in the best position for myself and it was a blessing in disguise. So that all being said, it required—I started looking at other options. So I reached out to the one person who's always been there for me through tough times, the smartest person I know, my uncle. And I was like, hey, you know, this is a situation. And I just was just telling him what it was. He was like, wait, you can get out early? So, like, what do you need?

And he's never judged me. Like, I came out here in 2008 and fucked up when I was young. He took me under his wing, taught me so much. I learned so much from under his wing. But I was still young, dumb, making bad decisions, and I blew the opportunity, and took the easy way out and ended up learning a lot, but I was still in this young mindset and wanted to party and hang out and do dumb shit. So I ended up going back home and that was in '08 that I went back home to California after being in Florida for like a year and a half. And I stayed on track for a long time and did well, but then I just slowly, like, if things didn't go right, I was just in an environment where it was easy to make the wrong decisions and the people I was around, the influence around me was just—it was just easy to make those decisions. And I always chose the easy route. And so I would resort to crime or selling drugs instead of really working hard and not taking the easy way out.

So eventually that got me caught up, got me into trouble and I caught myself, earned myself, a 10 year sentence or a 12 year sentence in federal prison. So that being said, fast forward through all of that to the point where I spoke with my uncle again, he was like, listen, there's so much going on out here. You need to get out here. And he didn't even tell me—he didn't—there was so much going on. And he understood, you just, you're not going to be able to fully comprehend it without being immersed in it. So he just—you need to get out here, so much is moving so fast. Like, just get out here. I'm gonna talk to Michelle, which is his wife. And you can use our home, you can come stay here if they'll let you.

So I put in a transfer, a relocation, and set that as the home and they granted it. And I was approved to come to Florida. And that's where everything changed.

Another, just for context, another example of hearing about ChatGPT was when I was in prison. I used to be in the library or the chapel room or the study room. And I used to be just reading books and studying and writing notes and having business ideas and writing it all out by hand. And there was an Asian dude in there who he had a lot of time, but he was really sharp. He was like a math whiz, right? And he was always researching things. Or he was always in there studying. And so I started talking to him because I see him in there every day. Like, what you working on, bro?

And he was like, he had been doing the deep learning stuff, the math side of AI. And he was already working on stuff in there doing algorithms and stuff like that. He was brilliant. And I was in there working on something just a concept—the pain point was that we had to use email to reach out to people. That was the only form of communication we had outside of the cell phone. So they had these text services where you can essentially connect through a phone number that would—you can have a phone number or an email that you would write to and that email would send your message to a phone number as a text. So like because most people didn't want to log into the app and check—most people are just used to having text messages. So it was like an email to text to the person, and then they would—you had a phone number associated. You had to pay for this service. It was like a text service through a third-party service. And I'm sure they routed it a certain type of way.

So I had a phone number and if anybody text that phone number, it would get routed to me as an email through my Corrlinks system in federal prison and then vice versa. If I put the phone number in the subject heading and hit send, it would go to their system and their system would route it as a text message and that's how I stayed in contact with people. So whenever, like, because I'm always in there doing research and I'm like, I need answers to certain questions. So I'm sending mom text messages like, hey, mom, what's answers to this or shooting her messages. And I was like, man, this is so fucking irritating, right?

I was thinking, what if there was a way to do this faster or you can have somebody do this research for you on the outside, through this texting? So I'm thinking through all of this with limited understanding of what's going on in the real world. But the Asian dude understood more of this chat interface and AI intelligence, right? So he's like, just—why don't you just make a chatbot? And I'm like, the only thing I understood about a chatbot is like—it was so behind, right? So when he's saying chatbot, to me, I'm like, I don't get it, brother. And like, no, no, no, no. Like you have to actually be able to talk and say—like, no, a chatbot is going to, it's not going to be enough.

But I didn't understand what he did. And that's where people are at when it comes to ChatGPT. They don't realize a chatbot isn't like Siri where you ask it a question and it says some dumb shit. It's like, you ask it a question and it fully understands what you're saying and can articulate back and then help you brainstorm. It was the perfect answer to my question, but I didn't know what was possible. So I could not correlate. I could not understand.

So that is—now, not understanding what he understood, if that system could be plugged in, I could have got so much work done. If I just had the ability to chat, to send a text message to a phone to a chat, to an OpenAI, to a ChatGPT and then get the answers back, I would be able to transform the amount of work that I did in prison because a lot of that is just hurry up and wait. That's what we saw. I said, hurry up and wait. That was the motto there because everything was slowed down, right? So that would have sped up all kinds of research and things like that. Because, I mean, who wants to go back and forth with somebody that's in prison at this? Like, hey, can you research this or look up this or look up that? Like, man, people on the streets are like, man, they will get sick of me because I just got all these ideas and I'm asking questions and they're just like, man, listen, bro, I ain't got time for that.

But ChatGPT and these AI tools, they don't get frustrated or impatient with me. They just spit it back and that was exactly what I wish I had. So that was my basic, my first—I remember that, right? But I didn't fully understand it.

Fast forward to getting out. I get out and I'm in a halfway house. So the only thing that I really have is a cell phone. And still, every morning, 5 a.m., I'm on phone calls, team meetings with my uncle and the whole team at Analytics AIML. So they're talking about all this AI stuff. So I'm downloading ChatGPT for the first time and I'm still using it like Google, right? And the learning curve for me at that point was so hard. And my uncle was so frustrated with me because he's been in this for so long. He's like, no, no, no, you're doing it—he's trying to explain all this stuff. And I was like, it was mental load, right?

Like, but when you have somebody that understands something at such a high level, pushing down on you and not babying you, and you really want to absorb the information, you're going to absorb it so fast. And I have really transformed the way that I understand how to use AI and basically I went from the Stone Ages to, I feel like 10 years ahead of a lot of people. Like, that's crazy. To be 10 years behind and then get out and be 10 years ahead of a lot of people in many respects because I understand what's possible. And then I'm so—my imagination just runs wild and I just go crazy.

So, and then my learning curve, you got to understand, I've been gone for so long. There's so much that I've been missing and trying. So it's like, I am the same person that the people back in Gutenberg's time. Probably the people that didn't know how to read and just were hearing people get up and read from a Bible that they didn't understand and they're telling them what's in these books, but they can't read. They don't know if it's true. Like, that's me, right? I don't know what's going on. I don't know what's true, but I want to learn. I want the information so bad that I learned this hard skill so fast. And then the technology gives it to me and makes it possible for me to learn and be a part of what's going on, what's this new development.

So I just happened to get out in the onset of an entire revolutionary technology. And right when it hit. April 19th, 2023, I got released from prison. Federal prison. And I have absorbed all of this. This was—it's the same play from Gutenberg. I learned a new skill. I can now not only can I read, I'm able to—I don't know how to code. I don't know any of that. None of those hard skills do I know. But with ChatGPT, I've gone from writing and reading by hand and talking on the phone and emails through a federal system to being able to build an app, to build a website for my brother's business to creating logos for other friends and family and business owners to automating entire processes for systems to generating content on social media to taking generating images and creating articles and writing in different types of formats. Like that's augmentation. And that's supercharged—that's supercharging my ability right now at this very moment in time. So that is the entire story for, I guess this piece. And hopefully that helps you.

## Key Points

- Home confinement denied because mom failed probation officer's test—"I don't know. He could take the bus or something"—watching other inmates get three years home confinement while stuck inside
- "I think it was more God just aligning me and putting me in the best position for myself and it was a blessing in disguise"—denial led to uncle's intervention and Florida relocation
- Uncle's response: "There's so much going on out here. You need to get out here. You're not going to be able to fully comprehend it without being immersed in it"—didn't even try to explain AI over the phone
- Asian math whiz in prison library working on deep learning algorithms—suggested chatbot solution to prison research pain point, but speaker couldn't comprehend what was possible
- Prison communication system: Corrlinks email-to-text service to stay in contact with outside world—constantly asking mom research questions, getting frustrated with slow "hurry up and wait" process
- Critical misconception: "A chatbot isn't like Siri where you ask it a question and it says some dumb shit"—ChatGPT fully understands, articulates back, helps brainstorm
- "ChatGPT and these AI tools, they don't get frustrated or impatient with me. They just spit it back and that was exactly what I wish I had"—infinite patience for endless questions
- Released April 19th, 2023—halfway house, 5AM phone calls with uncle and Analytics AIML team, downloaded ChatGPT but used it like Google initially
- Uncle's pressure: "No, no, no, you're doing it—" frustrated but pushing hard without babying—"when you have somebody that understands something at such a high level, pushing down on you and not babying you, you're going to absorb it so fast"
- Gutenberg parallel: "I am the same person that the people back in Gutenberg's time. Probably the people that didn't know how to read and just were hearing people get up and read from a Bible"—couldn't verify truth, desperate for information
- Transformation: "I went from the Stone Ages to 10 years ahead of a lot of people. To be 10 years behind and then get out and be 10 years ahead"—understanding what's possible unlocks imagination
- No coding skills, no hard skills—but with ChatGPT: built apps, built brother's website, created logos, automated processes, generated social media content, created images and articles
- "It's the same play from Gutenberg. I learned a new skill"—literacy revolution parallel to AI revolution, both democratize access to intelligence
