# Porty Riley Dream Home Deal - Navigating Designer Collaboration and 30% Markup to Close 7-Bed Order

## Transcript

OK, just finished working with a guest. Her name is Porty—P-O-O-R-T-I—last name Riley. And her son, Kyle, was with her. Looks like he goes to USF. She was coming in. She just purchased her dream home. It took her 30 years to get to this place and she's really excited. She hired a designer whose name is Lisa and she is having Porty come into Mattress Firm here and just figure out what mattress she wants.

And then she had a bunch of specs, which I will drop in as well so you can kind of see them. But basically what she's doing, she needs four queen sized mattresses that are 10 inches. So she's really specific about the bunks, the bunk beds. And she needs two king sized mattresses for the guest bedroom. Those need to be between 12 and I'm not sure, like 14 inches anyways, it's like 12 inches. The king sized master bedroom needs to be between, I think it was 12 and 16 inches or something like that.

So I took her through the whole process. I immediately pulled up ChatGPT as soon as she said she had multiple beds. I said, I just want to stay on track and make sure that I have everything in order. She sent me, I had her shoot me an image of the specs that the designer gave to her so we could stay on track.

I immediately took her to the Bicelle Medium memory foam. It's a bed in the box. Very comfy. I get a lot of great reviews. This is perfect for this type of situation. My stepdaughter has this mattress in a full at home and she loves it, swears by it. Very comfy. So I pulled it down. She tried it, said, oh, it's nice. Had Luke, her son tried it, and he was like, man, this is perfect. Boom, we locked that in. Four of those in Queen.

From there, we transitioned over to the guest bedroom. So I showed her a few different options and ended up going with a traditional style mattress there. Usually, the reasoning behind this is I like to follow what businesses that have been doing it the longest follow their recipe, right? And the businesses that accommodate the most customers in guest rooms are hotels, right? So usually a hotel mattress is a traditional style. They'll stay with a firm. They'll usually add a memory foam topper, a mattress protector, good sheets, pillows, etcetera. And that's usually their recipe.

So I showed her some traditional mattresses. She liked that. Showed her the Sleepys by Sealy Spring Innerspring, and she kind of liked the medium one. Thought that was good. I can get that for a really good price, probably around $699 or so right now. But I showed her one more. Let me show you another option. This is, I call this old faithful. These are the Pressure Smart 2.0 Plush Beautyrest mattresses. They haven't changed since I've been working here. They're the same mattress. Great edge support, very comfy, traditional style, just really nice bed. Nothing too fancy, perfect for a guest bedroom. Amazing. She ended up, she laid on and said, oh, this is my favorite out of all of them so far. So ended up going with those.

And she said, yeah, let's go with these. Now, they're a little expensive right now, but I know that I can usually hunt them down, find them in outlet and get her a sweet deal on them.

Now, after we kind of locked that in, she's like, let's talk about my bed. Perfect. Now, she has lower back pain. This was something that she really wanted to focus on preventing and solving for. And she asked me, immediately when we walked in, she's like, I have back pain. Like, what's the best mattress for back pain? I said, you need a base.

So she said she doesn't like a super soft mattress. I said, okay, perfect. I'm going to show you, I'm going to put you on something you don't like, which I usually like to do. So I took her to the Tempur-Pedic Luxe Breeze Soft with the adjustable base. I had her lay on the mattress and she was all for it. She was following along. She didn't have any problem laying in the mattress.

And then I gave her the base demo where I elevated her feet above her chest, above her heart rate, took pressure off her lower back. I did the same thing. I had Luke on the other side, was doing the same demo for him and then elevated her head slightly, about 10, 12 degrees, helped put that natural C curve in her back and she was like, yeah, this is great. I like this. This feels fine.

And then I showed her the lumbar support. So as I started dialing in the lumbar support, I'm explaining to her that this is how you kind of dial in the position. And she's like, well, I think I would like it down a little bit further. So I'm like, well, that's perfect. That's the power of this. You'll be able to make the adjustments and figure out exactly what works best for you.

And then she told me, she's like, well, I sleep on my side or my stomach. I said, perfect, that's me too. I sleep, I'm a stomach sleeper, but I like a soft mattress. The reason why I love an adjustable base is because you have the ability to stay in a mattress that you find most comfortable and still get the spinal alignment you need. So I showed her, I flattened it back out, and she did not like that feel, right? Neither did Luke, but showed them the examples.

And then I showed her how if she laid on her stomach, how I can add support. Now she understood the power of the base, understood how to utilize it. She's had a base before, but never used it. And I told her, like, yeah, I see this all the time. People come in, they have a base, they said they have back pain. And then they just don't know how, no one ever showed them how to use a base. I was taught how to use it by a woman who was a nurse.

So yeah, that's the goal. She understood and decided to go with the base. Loves the mattress, wants the base, cool. Then I talked to her about how it can all sit in the room and how that would work. She said, just talk to Lisa. So we're going to get that all squared away. So I'm going to collaborate with Lisa to understand exactly the other specs that may need to be taken into account and then all delivery information. She's basically going to have Lisa reach out to me and then I will work with Lisa and Lisa can either make the payment or whatever on her behalf.

So after we got all that squared away, we decided to look into pillows and things like that. I had her, I always like to have people try, figure out what pillow they want while they're in the mattress as well. And the pillow's 25% of your sleep surface. We call it the bed for your head. So she ended up trying a couple different ones, ends up going with the Luxe Breeze or going with the Tempur Breeze pillow in the high profile. So ended up getting that.

Then I showed her our Sleepy's deluxe charcoal pillows, and Luke tried those out and ended up saying that he liked the medium best. So ended up getting a whole bunch of those. So we need eight pillows for the bunks and four pillows for the guest room. So a total of 12 of those pillows. And then the two king sized Breeze pillows for her in her dream bed for her dream home.

Now, her home is in Colorado. She's not going to need delivery until December 15th. She's hoping it'll be a little sooner, hopefully the 10th, maybe a week before that, the earlier, the better. She was expecting it to be done and ready for her by Thanksgiving, but that doesn't look like it's going to be the case. So she's just trying to get ahead of the game.

Now, when she works with the designer, she likes the designer, she's great, but anything that the designer does on her behalf charges her 30% extra. But she did tell her if she figures out what mattress she can get, she can get a better deal. But that deal is going to still be with her tax on it. So I'm not sure how that is. So Porty was just telling me like, if I can get her a better deal or find a way to save her some money, great.

And when I told her, I'm like, I'm going to find you the bases in outlet. And I'll also find the other mattresses for the guest bedroom in outlet as well, and I'll save you a bunch of money there. And then we'll just leverage your big purchase for the main bedroom. We'll leverage that and then I'll stuff a bunch of goodies in and save you some money overall.

So that's the goal and she wants me to reach out, send her an email with the breakdown and a quote, and then all my contact information as well as some follow-ups and things like that. So I'm going to stay on top of this, reach out to her, and I want to make sure that she has everything that she needs all detailed and outlined based on the specs that the designer needs and also on the things that she found to be most important and why.
