# Payday Friday - Why Doing the Right Thing Finally Clicked After a Year and a Half

## Transcript

What up y'all, it's Friday on the way to work man, it's payday. Give a piece of my mind real quick.

Doing the right thing, man. It's crazy man. I never realized what it would give me, the benefits of just doing the right thing. Cuz I was always doing the wrong thing or taking shortcuts. You know what I mean? Just little slick [stuff], thinking I'm slick, thinking I can get over on [people]. And some of that stuff was working or what I felt was working but I never tried doing it the right way, doing the right thing, trying to live congruent. None of that.

So I have been lately. I would say like for sure for the last year and a half, maybe two years. Not even two years but at least for a year and a half straight been doing the right thing. I ain't got no shots, no write ups, nothing. And you can ask anybody that been down with me, that wasn't me before. That wasn't me. Never had clear conduct. None of that.

But I had to take a real look at myself cuz [stuff] wasn't working. So I had to really—I don't know, I think it was my bro Ease told me, bro, it ain't that hard. It ain't that hard. And for some reason what he said clicked and I was like, you know what [man], maybe it's you. And that's when I started pointing at myself instead of pointing at everything else around me and everybody else. And that's when I was like, okay, take ownership. Take accountability and control what you can and let go the [stuff] you can't. Boom. Something right there switched for me.

And people—the thing is, you know when something switches. Not when you point it out yourself. You pointing things out, oh yeah, I'm this, I'm that. Yeah, all right, that's cool and all. But you'll know when some things start really switching and when things start clicking when other people point it out. Damn bro, I don't know what it is bro, but whatever you doing bro, keep doing. I see you. You got a different glow about yourself. You glowing. I was getting that. And that's when it started clicking for me.

So doing the right thing man, all that manifested into me being where I'm at right now. Yeah, some people be—you walking, you want a buzz? Yeah, all right. But I'm free though. Mentally, spiritually, you know what I mean? I'm free. All that. I'm good. I'm good in this stage. And that all came from accepting things and being accountable, taking ownership. All that.

So today I went in to speak with my case manager and I'm always owner about everything. I'm always—the communication is always open with me. I'm always transparent. I understand this. What a conversation I had with her early on, I said, I know I'm coming in with this much credibility. Cool. I'm cool. That's cool. We can start there. We can start backwards if you want. But I'm doing the right thing and I'm going keep doing the right thing regardless. And you going to see that. And all I'm asking is when you start to see that and you see that I ain't moving like how these rules and things are set up to ensure, I'm just asking for you to put me in for the things that I got coming.

And she was cool, she was receptive to it. But it's taking what, 30 days now of me doing the right thing. Checking in, doing my little time stamps on the phone and then calling in credibility checks. Saying I'm going to go get a job, go out on these passes, come back with my hair done, come back with a job, come back with some new clothes for work, come back with all the [stuff] I'm saying I'm going to do. Not no [BS].

Things go wrong. I get caught up in traffic. I look like I'm going to be late. I'm calling ahead of time because I got an app on my phone that's showing the directions. Okay, I know this time that I'm about to show up is 5 minutes or 10 minutes later than when I'm supposed to be there. I know this 15 minutes in advance. So if I'm doing the right thing, I should be able to call in and get them a heads up.

I don't—and that's the thing that be killing them. And other guys don't do it because they trying to wiggle and do [stuff], right? So they're not even looking at [stuff] that is going on ahead of time. If you're doing the right thing, you're seeing [stuff] in advance. You are planning for everything that you doing. You are ahead of the game. You're already steps ahead of the game cuz you know where you going.

So when [stuff] don't line up, they be questioning [people]. Like hold up, how did you—nah, that's not how [stuff] works. If you doing what you said you was—you was going to do this, this, this—and then the lies start coming out and guys start getting themselves jammed up and doing all that.

So I say that to say, me doing the right thing has reinforced my character, has reinforced my character and what I'm presenting to her. And I'm everything I'm saying I am. So she's able to give me a little bit more leash here. Okay, I'm going give you this. And then she even be trying me. I know she be trying me. She didn't—I don't know if this for real but she sent me the wrong address one time to go to my after care or something. I get there and it's on the whole other side of town. I'm like, wait, what the [heck]? And so she boom, corrects it. And I had to work through it. I had to work through it.

So they may give you little things just a test to see how you going to handle stressful situations because you for real don't know what you don't know yet. So you got to get put in these situations and maybe they'll give you something and maybe it's just a trial. So just even if it's not, just take it like it is. Oh, this is just a test to see if I'm good, if I'm right, if I'mma handle this right. So look at things like that. Like okay, it's just a test. Okay, what can I learn? What is life trying to show me right now? What lesson is life trying to show me, the universe trying to show me right now that I need to pick up on? Okay, bet. You know what I'm saying? Peel the silver lining. Smack off. That's it.

And my case manager just put me in for ankle monitor to go on weekend passes so I can go build with my uncle. He needs me to be there in person because this phone, Zoom, all this other [stuff]—that's not—we're not able to get things done efficiently. So you got to be able to be in person with people. You know what I mean? So that's going to give me some—now I'm going to be able to pick up the pace with these weekend passes.

But she's also seeing that this could slow me down being in the halfway house. So she really is trying to put me on home confinement and get me out of here all together. And she's looking ahead. She's looking out for me. You know what I mean? And people don't look out for people that they don't trust. Trust comes from doing the right thing. That's it. Y'all be [easy].
